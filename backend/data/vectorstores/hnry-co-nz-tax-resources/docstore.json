[["0",{"pageContent":"ACC guide for sole traders Your complete guide to understanding ACC and the three levies  If you‚Äôve ever, say, accidentally dislocated your shoulder while snowboarding, you‚Äôre probably familiar (and grateful for) ACC and their services. But what you might not know is that these services are funded by levies that all working Kiwis pay. For those who are newly self-employed, finding out you owe levies to ACC may come as a surprise in your first year of business. And even if you‚Äôve been around for a while, it‚Äôs still no fun to receive that once-a-year ACC invoice in the mail. Everyone who works or owns a business in New Zealand is subject to paying these levies. But while PAYE employees have their levies automatically deducted from their paycheck and paid by their employers, sole traders are responsible for calculating and paying their levies on their own. There are three ACC levies in total, each calculated slightly differently depending on your circumstances. All three levies are due once a year, when ACC sends out their invoices ‚Äì and they can be a bit pricey. The good news is that you can lessen the load by regularly putting aside money for your levies throughout the year. We‚Äôll take you through:  What ACC is and does What ACC levies are The different levels of ACC cover available for sole traders How to calculate your ACC levies How Hnry can help (because we really can!)  Let‚Äôs get started! What is ACC? Tl;dr The Accident Compensation Corporation, more commonly known as ACC, is a government organisation that essentially acts as a public health insurance company. If anyone in New Zealand is injured (including visitors and those who aren‚Äôt currently working), ACC will help pay for medical costs, support at home and work, and any loss of income. The longer version New Zealand has a long, proud history of worker‚Äôs compensation, starting with the Worker‚Äôs Compensation Act in 1900. It was one of the first of its kind in the world, creating a ‚Äòno fault‚Äô system under which:  Employers were required to take out insurance to cover injuries to employees Injured workers received weekly compensation payments Families of workers who were fatally injured received compensation.  Because of the ‚Äòno fault‚Äô nature of cover, people were protected without needing to sue anyone, including their employers (although they could sue for carelessness if they wanted to). Successive governments expanded the act, often based on feedback from workers,","metadata":{"id":0}}],["1",{"pageContent":" Because of the ‚Äòno fault‚Äô nature of cover, people were protected without needing to sue anyone, including their employers (although they could sue for carelessness if they wanted to). Successive governments expanded the act, often based on feedback from workers, until finally, ACC was born in 1974. Today, the modern ACC has several different responsibilities, including:  Helping pay for medical and/or physio bills in case of an accident Helping pay for counselling and support for sensitive claims Covering loss of income (up to a certain percentage) if someone is unable to work due to an injury Working with partners and communities to create resources and help prevent injuries (they even have a quiz to assess your attitude towards risk!)  In short, if you have the misfortune to meet with an accident in Aotearoa, ACC has got your back. What are ACC levies? Taking care of the injuries of an entire country can get expensive! To help offset the costs, ACC collects levies from all working New Zealanders. These levies are in addition to the income tax you pay each year. Once you register as a sole trader, you‚Äôll receive your first invoice after you file your first tax return. Surprise! (No, seriously; so many sole traders are surprised by their first ACC invoice because they assume filing their taxes is a one-and-done deal. Spoiler alert: it‚Äôs not. Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about prepping for the end of the financial year.) From then on, an ACC invoice will be sent to you sometime between July and September each year. üìñGot your invoice, but struggling to decode it? Check out our article on understanding your ACC invoice. The three ACC levies Everyone who earns income in New Zealand pays the Earners‚Äô levy, no matter what kind of work you do. Businesses pay two other levies, the Work levy and the Working Safer levy. Unfortunately, as sole traders count as both earners and businesses, you‚Äôll have to pay all three. Each levy is calculated slightly differently (with rates updated every April):  the Earner‚Äôs levy is a flat rate of $1.27 per $100 (excluding GST) of your liable income  this helps fund cover for injuries that happen during everyday, non-work activities   the Working Safer levy is a flat rate of $0.08 per $100 of your liable income  this helps fund Worksafe NZ, New Zealand‚Äôs primary workplace health and","metadata":{"id":1}}],["2",{"pageContent":" helps fund cover for injuries that happen during everyday, non-work activities   the Working Safer levy is a flat rate of $0.08 per $100 of your liable income  this helps fund Worksafe NZ, New Zealand‚Äôs primary workplace health and safety regulator   the Work levy is based on the industry you operate in  this helps funds cover for injuries that happen at work the riskier your line of work, the higher this levy will be    The amount of income assessed by the Earners‚Äô levy is capped, which means for that levy the most you‚Äôll pay is roughly $2,000.  How to calculate your ACC levies If this all wasn‚Äôt complicated enough, there are a few more things you need to know in order to accurately calculate your ACC levies (phew!). Firstly, the levies you pay are all calculated off your liable income, which is based on the information you declare when you do your taxes. üí° The termliable income refers to income that is subject to ACC levies. ACC sets a minimum and maximum threshold for liable income every financial year, and you‚Äôre only required to pay levies on your taxable earnings between these thresholds. You can read more about these thresholds on ACCwebsite. Your levies also depend on the type of cover you have, and your Classification Unit (basically, what type of work you do). Here we go! The Earner‚Äôs levy Good news: the Earner‚Äôs levy is incredibly straightforward. To calculate your levy, you take your liable income, divide it by 100, and then multiply that number by 1.27. Voila!  The Working Safer levy The Working Safer levy is also simple to calculate ‚Äì in fact, you can use the exact same equation. Only this time, rather than multiplying your liable income by 1.27, you multiply it by 0.8 instead.  The Work levy Here‚Äôs where things get tricky. In order to calculate your Work levy, you‚Äôll need to find your Classification Unit (CU). Each CU has a different Work levy rate ‚Äì essentially the riskier the profession, the higher the levy.  There‚Äôs a CU for every occupation, from ‚ÄúAlpine Recreational Activities‚Äù to ‚ÄúZoological Garden Operation‚Äù, so you‚Äôll need to find the exact right code for you. If you fail to provide a CU to ACC, and they‚Äôre unable to figure it out from your tax filing, they‚Äôll assign you a","metadata":{"id":2}}],["3",{"pageContent":"‚Äù to ‚ÄúZoological Garden Operation‚Äù, so you‚Äôll need to find the exact right code for you. If you fail to provide a CU to ACC, and they‚Äôre unable to figure it out from your tax filing, they‚Äôll assign you a code with one of the highest levy rates. To be on the safe side. Once you‚Äôve found the right CU, you‚Äôll need to look up the corresponding levy rate in ACC‚Äôs levy guidebook. The basic levy rate will be listed in the ‚ÄúEMP or SEP‚Äù column.  (Warning: this thing is a whopping 136 pages long. We recommend using the Ctrl+F search function.) Once you‚Äôve found the right levy rate, we‚Äôre back to mathematical smooth sailing.  CoverPlus vs. CoverPlus Extra One last thing‚Ä¶ When you pay your ACC levies, you‚Äôll be covered for accidents or injuries under a plan called CoverPlus. If you‚Äôre unable to work, CoverPlus will pay you up to 80% of your income, calculated based on your reported income from the most recent financial year. But depending on your needs, lifestyle, and expenses, you might want even more cover. Makes sense. If this is the case, you can opt to be on a plan called CoverPlus Extra (CPX). With CPX, you can choose how much you want to receive weekly in the event of an injury or accident (subject to an assessment to determine an appropriate level of cover). This comes in handy if:  Your income fluctuates from week to week You want to be covered for more than you‚Äôve earned in the previous financial year You want to be covered for less than you earn, and reduce your levy rate  CoverPlusCoverPlus ExtraCovers out 80% of your income, but may be reduced if your business continues to generate income.Based on your earnings during the last financial yearTo receive compensation, you‚Äôll have to prove your loss of earningsCovers 100% of the agreed amount, no questions asked.Lets you choose how much you‚Äôre covered forRequires no proof of loss of earnings There are significant advantages to upgrading to CoverPlus Extra, especially if you‚Äôre newly self-employed with no earnings history, or if your business would have a hard time proving a loss of income.

This is a common misconception. In fact, there is very little advantage of registering a company when you‚Äôre trading as an individual, and for some it can result in increased compliance costs and headaches. We‚Äôve put together this comprehensive guide, to help you find out more about whether it‚Äôs worth you registering a company when you‚Äôre a contractor or freelancer.

It is a legal entity that has Directors and Shareholders and has its own set of tax filing and compliance requirements, separate from you as an individual taxpayer. A ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô is any trading operation, where goods and services are being sold. Running a ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô doesn‚Äôt require you to register a company - you can run a business as an individual sole trader, freelancer, or contractor. What are the additional requirements of you when you have a company? If you are the Director of a registered company, you will be required to maintain the records and tax affairs of that company. The main requirements are:  Filing annual company returns with the Companies Office (and detailing the names and addresses of all Directors on their publicly-searchable register) Calculating, paying and filing company Income Tax (IR4) returns every year Calculating, paying and filing GST returns on a regular basis Managing company ACC levies and payments  Each of these are in addition to any responsibilities you have as an individual Director of that company. As a Director, you will be responsible for all your individual tax affairs, such as Income Tax (IR3) returns, ACC levies (where not covered by the company) and any other personal tax and compliance requirements. All of the above have a cost associated, whether you are doing them yourself or whether you pay someone else to administer your company for you. Do you have to register a company to be a self-employed contractor or freelancer? No. It is often the case that self-employed contractors, freelancers and sole traders carry out their business as an individual, with no need to register a company. Individuals can still register for GST, raise invoices, claim business and home office expenses, hire staff, depreciate assets, trade under a Trading Name and get all of the trappings of being a business such as having a website, physical premises and business cards, all without needing to register a company. Usually it is only necessary to register a company if you have the following complexities in your business:  You are employing staff on permanent or fixed term salaries, and therefore require payroll services (although you can do this as an individual) You need to maintain a complex inventory of goods, and manage the supply of your inventory You have creditors, and other organisations are providing you a line of credit to allow you to defer payment for their goods and services.

You have multiple Directors, shareholders or a complex ownership structure that requires a company  To manage the above complexities, you would also need various additional tools for your company, such as complex accounting software (designed for small-to-medium sized business), payroll software (to file your monthly payday filing schedules to IRD) as well as inventory management tools. For the vast majority of contractors and freelancers who do not have this level of complexity, these tools, (and therefore registering a company) can be unnecessary, and can result in increased costs and administration headaches. I‚Äôve heard that it reduces my risk if I register a company, is this correct? No. These days, despite them sometimes being called a ‚Äòlimited liability company‚Äô, registering a company does not necessarily reduce your risk if you are a contractor or freelancer. If you are running a business that takes on large numbers of creditors, you may want to structure yourself as a company to give yourself some protection in the event that your company is forced into bankruptcy. However, as the Director of a company you would still be responsible for the activities and actions of that company, and you would still be at risk of litigation. There is no option to ‚Äòhide‚Äô behind a company structure as a way of indemnifying yourself as an individual. As an example, in November 2020 the Supreme Court found the director of a company in breach of his duty to act in good faith and in the best interests of his company; he was ordered to personally pay $280,000 to the company‚Äôs creditors. Most contractors and freelancers do not bear this sort of risk through their self-employed work. The vast majority are trading as individuals and earning income from time spent. They don‚Äôt have creditors, and they have no risk of defaulting on fixed goods orders. In cases where freelancers or contractors work in an industry where there is risk - such as potential accusations of malpractice - or if their clients require them to take further risk mitigation steps, then individuals can take out a Professional Indemnity and Public Liability Insurance policy. Such a policy would cover them in the event of any legal action being taken against them. This insurance is very easy to get, and is far cheaper and more efficient than registering a company.

This insurance is very easy to get, and is far cheaper and more efficient than registering a company. Do I pay less tax if I pay myself through a company? No. As an individual, the tax rates are all the same, whether you are paying yourself via a registered company, or as an individual. Any time you take money out of a company, and pay yourself as an individual, you pay income tax, ACC and any other applicable taxes on that income at the same rate as everyone else. It‚Äôs true that the Corporation Tax in New Zealand is a flat rate of 28%, which is lower than the individual top rate of tax, which is 39%. However, this does not mean that you as an individual can pay less tax by earning through a company. As soon as you take any money out of the company for yourself, you would pay the standard rates of individual income tax. For example, if you registered a company, and earned $50,000, you would most likely want to take that money out of the company and pay yourself. When you did so, you would pay income tax at around 16%. If you were to leave that money in the company instead, at the end of the financial year you would have to pay 28% on it. Given that most contractors and freelancers will want to take the majority of the money they earn and use it to fund their home life (pay the mortgage, bills, buy food etc), having a company is of no tax benefit whatsoever, and is actually just an unnecessary barrier between you and your income. If it‚Äôs not required, why do so many people do it? Many years ago, it used to be the case that you could ‚Äòfiddle‚Äô the system by registering a company, and paying yourself minimum wage, before taking ‚Äòdividends‚Äô out of the company at the end of the year at a lower rate of tax. IRD clamped down on these tax avoidance practices a long time ago, however some people are still under the impression that it is possible. It has also been a standard practice in the accounting industry for accountants to register contractors and freelancers as companies, because most accountants are more used to dealing with ‚Äòsmall business‚Äô clients rather than individuals.

Do IRD and MBIE advise individual contractors and freelancers to register companies? No. IRD and MBIE are currently going to great lengths to discourage individuals from unnecessarily registering companies. The advice from the government is very clear - that you should only register a company when necessary, and that for most freelancers and contractors, this is not required. IRD are aware that in some industries, it is common for sole individuals to register companies in order to trade as contractors, and they are currently taking steps to stop such practices and educate individuals that it is unnecessary.

If you‚Äôve registered a company by yourself, or you have had someone register a company on your behalf, and you now realise that you don‚Äôt need to operate as a company, you have a couple of options:   You can make the company dormant, and trade as an individual instead. This gives you the option of ‚Äòreviving‚Äô the company at some point, should your business grow to the level of complexity where a company is required.   You can close and ‚Äòstrike off‚Äô the company from the Companies Office register, thereby closing the company entirely and ceasing the company from trading altogether.

But there are cases where a Director of a company would still be responsible for the activities and actions of that company. Personal guarantees: With small companies, it‚Äôs common for banks or suppliers to ask for personal guarantees. If a personal guarantee is in place, a company structure essentially provides no protection for personal assets. Reckless trading: Directors may be found personally liable if the company is engaging in ‚Äúreckless trading.‚Äù Reckless trading is essentially running your business in a way that is likely to create a substantial risk of serious loss to the company‚Äôs creditors. Many sole traders don‚Äôt have creditors for their self-employed work - or if they do, they don‚Äôt borrow much. There‚Äôs no risk of defaulting on a personal loan, or reckless trading, and therefore no real need for an LLC.

For more information about tax rates, see our guide to tax rates for sole traders. üí°If you‚Äôre GST registered, claiming GST expenses happen separately from claiming tax deductions. For more information, check out our guide to GST. Who can claim tax deductions? In New Zealand, people who aren‚Äôt in business (eg. PAYE employees) can‚Äôt claim business expenses. They are eligible to claim tax deduction for a few specific things like: charitable donations, commission charged on earning interest or dividends, tax preparation fees income protection insurance and (ironically) the interest they pay the IRD for late payment of tax.  Companies usually cover all work-related costs for PAYE employees, which is why they aren‚Äôt eligible to claim work-related expenses as a general rule. Sole traders however can claim business expenses for costs incurred in relation to their work. As a general rule, you can claim a tax deduction for a business expense as long as: the expense relates directly to earning income, or running your business.  Claiming expenses are a brilliant way to pay less in taxes, while spending more money on your business. Huge win-win! ‚Ä¶ just make sure you‚Äôre claiming exactly what you spend, and you won‚Äôt be done for tax fraud (yikes). üí° Remember: if an expense is for both business and personal use, you can only claim costs for the business usage. üí° For more information on both business and personal tax deduction, check out the IRD‚Äôs handy guide to individual expenses. What expenses are tax deductible? Before we get to the good stuff, we need to talk about the exact difference between business expenses and tax deductions. These terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but they‚Äôre definitely not the same thing. In fact, contrary to popular belief, not all tax deductions are business expenses, and not all expenses are tax deductible. The more you know!  Simple! Yet confusing. We hear you.

In fact, contrary to popular belief, not all tax deductions are business expenses, and not all expenses are tax deductible. The more you know!  Simple! Yet confusing. We hear you. Let‚Äôs dive in. Business expenses Business expenses are the costs you incur as part of running your business day-to-day. Basically, if you need something to help you get the job done, that purchase will be a business expense. BUT the IRD won‚Äôt automatically accept every expense as a tax deduction. As we‚Äôve already talked about, they have strict criteria for what is and isn‚Äôt tax deductible. A good example is work clothes. The IRD only allows deductions for mandated uniforms, clothing with logos, and health and safety equipment.. Even if you only use certain clothes for work, if they could feasibly be worn outside of work, you‚Äôre out of luck. Sameer is a baker, specialising in complex cake art. Because his creations are usually quite delicate, he often cuts and serves his cakes at events as part of the service. He purchased black dress pants and a crisp white shirt to wear for these events, and only uses them while at work. But because he could reasonably wear this outfit to a personal event, it is not tax deductible according to the IRD.  Tax deductions We‚Äôve already covered what tax deductions are and how they work. But did you know that you can claim tax deductions for things other than business expenses? The most common example is charitable donations. Anything you donate to an IRD-approved charity is 33.33% tax deductible, as long as the donation:  is for $5 or more, doesn‚Äôt directly benefit you or your family, and wasn‚Äôt made as a way to forgive debt owed.  Donations are a great way to align your sole-trader brand with some fantastic causes ‚Äì all while reducing your taxable income. With all this in mind, let‚Äôs update that snazzy venn diagram:  üí°You can use Hnry‚Äôs Allocation feature to donate a percent of every pay to your favourite charity. For more information, check out this article written by our partners at Supergenerous on charitable giving and tax deductions.

Examples of deductible expenses Industry-specific deductions The IRD‚Äôs guidelines are actually just a starting point, and claimable expenses differ between industries and contexts. For example:  A musician can claim funky outfits they wear when performing A tradie can claim a hard hat they need to keep them safe.  Because of this, you can‚Äôt automatically claim everything your friends and family claim ‚Äì their deductions might not be applicable to your industry. Partially-deductible expenses Some business expenses are also only partially tax deductible. For example, you can only claim a deduction for:  The business use of a work vehicle, not the personal. The percentage of your internet bill you used for business purposes while working from home. 50% of certain entertainment expenses.  üí°You need to be able to prove that an eligible expense was partly or solely for business use. Otherwise, it might not fly with the IRD. If in doubt about an expense, you should run it by your accountant or tax agent (or the friendly Hnry team!). Depreciating Assets Finally, there are depreciating assets, which are claimed a little differently. A depreciating asset is an asset worth more than $1000 that declines in value over time as it‚Äôs used. This might include cars, tools, computers, even buildings! With these assets, you‚Äôre not actually claiming the cost of the asset itself, you‚Äôre claiming the amount it drops in resale value each year ‚Äì the depreciation. üí°Remember, like with all expenses, you can only claim depreciation for the business use of an asset. If you purchase a depreciating asset, there are two ways you can claim this as a tax deduction:  Straight line method  With this method, you can claim the same amount each year. It‚Äôs calculated as a percentage of the original cost of the asset.   Diminishing value method  With this method, depreciation is calculated each year using a constant percentage relative to the current value of the asset. It‚Äôs more reflective of the actual value of the asset, and means you‚Äôll claim more up front but less in later years.    Both methods will have rates and timelines set by the IRD. You can make sure you‚Äôre calculating depreciation accurately using their depreciation calculator. If you sell an asset partway through its depreciation, stop using it for business purposes, or even stop being a sole trader altogether, there will be tax and GST implications. Be sure to let your accountant (or Hnry","metadata":{"id":16}}],["17",{"pageContent":" their depreciation calculator. If you sell an asset partway through its depreciation, stop using it for business purposes, or even stop being a sole trader altogether, there will be tax and GST implications. Be sure to let your accountant (or Hnry tax specialist!) know as soon as anything changes. Using Hnry means never having to think about depreciation again üéâ Simply raise the asset like a regular expense, and we‚Äôll automatically claim the depreciation for you. See how it works.  Keeping records for the IRD There‚Äôs nothing worse than putting hours of blood, sweat, and tears into your financial admin, only to realise at the end of the financial year that you lost the receipts! Keeping clear, organised records of purchases and goods/products sold will help make tax time as stress-free as possible. It‚Äôs also good practice; the IRD requires you to save a record of your expenses (receipts) for seven years after purchase, either physically or digitally. Imagine seven years of receipts strewn across your office floor, and you‚Äôll appreciate the value of a good filing system. Alternatively, if you‚Äôre a Hnry customer, you can take a quick photo of your receipts and upload them to the Hnry app. We‚Äôll calculate your expenses and claim your tax deductions for you, AND store your receipts for you for seven years from purchase. No shoebox full of records required ‚Äì ever again!  10 most common business expenses (as raised by Hnry users!) Now we get to the fun stuff! Here are the top 10 most-raised expenses for our users in the last financial year:  DepreciationAs already mentioned, any business asset purchased for over $1000 must be depreciated. If it‚Äôs for both business and personal use, you can only claim the business use. Subscription feesAny recurring subscription costs for business-related products e.g. recurring software costs, online magazines, newspaper magazine subscriptions, licensing fees. Light, power, heatingIf you work from home, you can claim the business percentage of your light, power, and heating bills. Calculate the percentage by figuring out the percentage of your home dedicated to your home office. Mobile phone billsRemember, if the phone is for both business and personal use, you can only claim the percentage of the bill that was for business use.

Internet billJust like your mobile phone bill, you can only claim for the cost of business use of your internet. You also can‚Äôt claim a deduction for installation or set-up costs.

If you‚Äôre a sole trader and you work from home, you may be able to claim a portion of your home running costs as Business Expenses if there is a connection between the use of your home and the business income being generated. Claiming home office expenses isn‚Äôt a straightforward process, however. To get it right you need to understand which of the two calculation methods will work best for you. How to claim To work out an appropriate Home Office percentage, you can either base it on the size of your home office, relevant to the size of your home, or calculate it based on the percentage you use your home for business Option 1: Calculating based on the size of your Home Office *We recommend this option ONLY if you have an area of your home that is solely dedicated to your business (e.g. a room that you use for you Home Office). * **Step 1 **is figuring out the area of the part of your house that you use solely for business - this can be measured by the equation area = length x width. Step 2 is working out the percentage of your total home represented by this space. To find this percentage you also need the total area of your house, which you can find by looking up your home address on homes.co.nz. Then you can use the following equation:  For example: If you have a 100m2 house and have a 12m","metadata":{"id":22}}],["23",{"pageContent":" need the total area of your house, which you can find by looking up your home address on homes.co.nz. Then you can use the following equation:  For example: If you have a 100m2 house and have a 12m2 office.  In this instance your home office percentage would be 12%. Provided you meet the rest of the criteria, here are a few examples of what you would be eligible to claim:  12% of power, gas, and heating 12% of mortgage interest or rent 12% of hand soap and toilet roll 12% of lightbulbs 12% of your home insurance  Option 2: Calculating based on time spent using your home for Business Purposes *We recommend using this option if you DO NOT have an area of your house that is solely dedicated to your business e.g. you work from the dining room using your laptop. * To calculate this you should start by recording the times that you are working from home over a 4 week period. This will give you a clear indication of how much you are using your home for your business versus personal use.  For example: You record the hours you spend working from home and establish that over the four-week period, you are working an average of 5 hours a week from home. There are 168 hours a week in total (24 hours/day x 7 days/week).  In this instance you are eligible to claim 3% of your home running costs as business expenses. Note: It is extremely unusual to have a home office percentage greater than 25%. IRD are regularly checking with customers regarding home office expense claims so you may be asked to verify how you calculated the home office percentage you are claiming for. What you can‚Äôt claim (using either method) Things that cannot be claimed as a home office expense include:  Food and drink Furniture and electronics that are not used solely for work purposes TV subscriptions, unless they are used only for work  It may seem easy to claim and keep claiming various expenses as home office expenses, but it‚Äôs very important that you only claim what you use for business purposes. Even if an accountant signs off on the liberties you want to take with your home office expenses, you‚Äôre the one who ultimately bears the risk - and the IRD can come down harshly with big fines on those who claim fraudulent business expenses.

The IR330C (Tax rate notification for contractors) form is an IRD form filled out by contractors, freelancers, and other self-employed individuals when they are working for large ‚Äòlabour hire‚Äô organisations in New Zealand. A ‚Äòlabour hire‚Äô organisation might be a recruitment agency, a large construction company, a film studio, or any other company that employs large numbers of independent contractors. For these labour hire organisations, it is mandatory for them to collect an IR330C form from you before they can pay you. On starting a contract working for a labour hire organisation you may be asked to fill in IR330C form. This form notifies your employer what rate of Income Tax you would like them to withhold from you each time they pay you. It is up to the individual contractor or freelancer to fill in, sign, and return this form to their employer. Failure to do so will result in your employer having to deduct up to 45% of your earnings as Income Tax before they pay you! Whenever you get paid through one of these organisations, they will then deduct that rate from your income as Income Tax, and they will also declare your total income to IRD. DOWNLOAD THE FORM ## How do you fill in the IR330C form? The IR330C form can be filled out on your computer and saved as a PDF - or printed and filled out manually. It should then be sent to your labour hire via email or delivered in person. An overview of how to fill in each section of the form is below: Section 1.

Common Mistakes with the IR330C form When completing an IR330C form, make sure that you are aware of these common misconceptions and mistakes:  The tax deducted is only the first part of your Income Tax. Depending on the percentage rate you choose, there may be further Income Tax to pay at the end of the year based on your total annual earnings. As a contractor, it is up to you to keep track of where further Income Tax is owing throughout the year, and put aside the relevant funds. The tax that is deducted from your pay is sometimes called Withholding Tax - which is identical to Income Tax. They are both one and the same. The tax deducted is only Income Tax - it does not cover your full tax liability as a self-employed individual. For example, Withholding Tax does not contribute to GST, ACC, or Student Loan repayments.

From calculating your taxes, to filling out the right forms, to claiming expenses, to filing returns, there‚Äôs a lot to do and remember. How do you know what your tax rate is? How do you calculate how much tax you owe? Which tax forms do you need to fill out, and by when? Old mate Gary claimed his weed whacker as a business expense ‚Äì should you be claiming yours?! Well firstly, unless you and Gary are landscapers or similar, it‚Äôs probably best to leave the weed whacker out of it. Secondly, the end of the financial year can absolutely be complicated. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve created this end-of-financial-year survival guide.

Don‚Äôt worry, it won‚Äôt take long. Everyone who makes a living in New Zealand is subject to income tax. Income tax helps keep our government and public services running ‚Äì basically, most of the common goods we enjoy (safe roads, sturdy bridges, Outrageous Fortune) are funded in part by the taxes we pay. Most PAYE (Pay As You Earn) employees have a set salary, or work a set number of hours every week. This makes their income regular and predictable, meaning that the amount of tax they owe is also regular and predictable. PAYE employees also generally can‚Äôt claim business expenses. Anything they need in order to perform their role should be provided by their employer, so in theory they have nothing to claim. Because of this, paying tax as a PAYE employee is so straightforward that they usually don‚Äôt have to think about it all. All they have to do is fill in an IR330 form when they start working, and the rest is handled by their company‚Äôs payroll. For sole traders, it‚Äôs a whole different ball game. To begin with, sole trader income can be quite variable, so the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) won‚Äôt know how much you earn until you tell them. Sole traders can also claim business expenses to lower their taxable income, meaning they can potentially lower their overall tax bill. That‚Äôs where tax returns come in. At the end of every financial year (FY), the IRD will need to know:  How much income you‚Äôve made The different sources of your income (self-employed income, rental income, dividends etc) The business expenses you‚Äôre claiming  Your tax return will tell them all these things. Think of it like a bar tab ‚Äì you‚Äôre figuring out who owes what, settling your account, and starting the new year with a clean slate. (Don‚Äôt think too hard about that analogy.)  Prepping your tax return To get your tax return done and dusted, you‚Äôll need a few things:  Your bank account details Details of your income over the past year A list of your business expenses for the FY (including receipts)  1.

It‚Äôs easy to get distracted when you‚Äôre preparing a tax return. 2. Your income over the past year For this, you‚Äôll need to know how much you‚Äôve earned exactly, and from where. Income streams can include things like:  A PAYE salary Self-employed income Rental income Interest Dividends A family trust ‚Ä¶ and even cryptocurrency!  All of these different types of income will need to be declared to the IRD in your IR3 form. Some of these income streams might need you to fill in a separate form (eg. an IR3R for rental income), but we‚Äôll get to that later. üí°If you have a PAYE salary, you‚Äôll already have paid some of your income tax. You can see this balance in MyIR, under ‚Äúcredit balance‚Äù ‚Äì this is the amount of tax you‚Äôve already paid. Once you have a full list of your income streams, you can figure out your taxable income for the financial year. But before you figure out your tax rate and calculate how much income tax you owe, you‚Äôll need to subtract‚Ä¶ 3. Your business expenses Here‚Äôs where things get even more complicated ‚Äì but in a good way! Claiming business expenses is a great way to reduce your overall tax bill, by lowering your taxable income. You don‚Äôt get a refund for your expenses, but you can use them to reduce the total tax you need to pay. Less taxable income means less tax owed. That‚Äôs why lowering your taxable income can result in lowering your effective tax rate.  Bridgette is a custom furniture maker. She receives an order for a bespoke dining table and cabinet sets, which requires a purchase of $7,000 worth of wood and other materials to complete.

Income tax Income tax is the tax levied on your income. Income tax rates are based on the income you make in a financial year, not a conventional year.   Provisional tax Provisional tax is a way of paying income tax in instalments over a financial year, instead of paying a lump sum at the very end. If you default on a tax bill of over $5000, you‚Äôll be required to pay provisional tax the following financial year.   Withholding tax Some sole traders and contractors work for clients who withhold a percentage of their pay as tax for the IRD. This is called withholding tax. It‚Äôs different from PAYE income tax because it‚Äôs not based on the sole trader‚Äôs tax rate, but rather a flat rate assigned to the sole trader‚Äôs industry. Because of this, sole traders and contractors who pay withholding tax often pay too much or too little tax overall. üí° You can use Hnry‚Äôs services even if you pay withholding tax.

Tax return A tax return is the form you fill declaring your income, expenses you‚Äôre claiming, and the amount of taxes you owe/should be refunded. For sole traders, this form is the ‚Äúindividual income tax return‚Äù, or the IR3.   Tax agent Tax agents are people or businesses who prepare the annual tax returns of 10 or more people. The IRD maintains a list of organisations and people who have tax agent status, and regularly removes those who no longer qualify. Not to brag, but Hnry is very much on that list. Whether you work for an employer or work for yourself as a contractor, freelancer, or self-employed tradie, taxes are unfortunately a fact of life. As much as we would all like to find ways to pay less tax, we‚Äôre sorry to confirm that if you‚Äôre earning an income, you‚Äôre obliged to pay the tax man. Ouch. To make matters more complicated, figuring out how much you owe the IRD can involve a fair bit of maths. Instead of a flat tax rate where you hand over a set percentage of your taxable income every year, New Zealand operates using a progressive tax system with several tax brackets. So what does this mean, exactly? Better yet, how can you make the most of this system to (legally) pay less in taxes? Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôve got you.

A tax rate is defined as the ratio between a sum of money and the tax owed on that money, calculated as a percentage. Don‚Äôt worry; it‚Äôs not as confusing as it sounds. For example, if you had $100 of taxable income, and paid $10 of that in tax, the ratio between income and tax would be 10:100, simplified to 1:10. This ratio in percentage form is 10% ‚Äì the tax rate. If you wanted to simplify that even further, you could take the maths out of it and think of it like this: A tax rate is the percentage at which a person or business is taxed.  Some tax rates are easy to calculate ‚Äì for example, GST (Goods and Services Tax). It‚Äôs levied at a flat rate of 15% on top of the cost of most goods and services. Fairly straightforward. Other tax rates change depending on the circumstances. For example, income in Aotearoa is taxed progressively, meaning that the tax rate is different for different tax brackets. Which leads us nicely to our next section: What‚Äôs a tax bracket? In Aotearoa, income tax is a progressive tax, meaning that the more you make, the higher your overall tax-to-income ratio. To this end, income levels are split into bands or brackets, each taxed at a different rate. Income tax brackets are the same for everyone, whether you‚Äôre a PAYE employee, a business owner, or a sole trader  Tax brackets and their corresponding tax rates are decided on by the New Zealand government ‚Äì they‚Äôre not set in stone. Different parties have different views on what fair taxation looks like, and economic factors (like inflation) can change the value of money to the point where the system isn‚Äôt working as designed. Although it doesn‚Äôt happen often, the government could change the bracket thresholds, the tax rates, or even add a new bracket into the mix (like the top 39% tax bracket created in the financial year 2021-22). Because of this, it‚Äôs a good idea to make sure you‚Äôre across the different tax rates and tax brackets each financial year ‚Äì just in case.

You‚Äôre required to pay income tax on any dollar you earn. With that in mind, here‚Äôs where it gets more complicated: Not every dollar you earn will be taxed at the same rate. And that‚Äôs where tax brackets come into play. It‚Äôs a common misconception that your entire salary is taxed at the rate of the top tax bracket you qualify for, but this isn‚Äôt actually true. For example, if you earn $50,000 a year, you may think you need to set aside 30% for tax, eg. $15,000. But our progressive tax rate system means that you actually pay 10.5% on the first $14k you earn, 17.5% on your earnings from $14,001 to $48,000, and 30% on anything over $48,001 (and under $70k): Bracket 1: 10.5% of $14,000 = $1,470 Bracket 2: 17.5% of $34,000 = $5950 Bracket 3: 30% of $2,000 = $600 Total income tax bill: $8,020 This makes your effective tax rate 16.04% - far less than paying 30% across the board! üìÑ An effective tax rate is exactly what it says on the tin: the actual percentage of your total income that you pay in taxes. Your effective tax rate is unique to your situation, and is a better metric for tracking your taxation levels than the tax rates and brackets. It will vary wildly depending on where your income falls within the bracket system ‚Äì the closer you are to the top end of the bracket threshold, the higher your effective tax rate will be.

There‚Äôs actually some good news here, especially if you‚Äôre a sole trader. You can reduce your taxable income ‚Äì and therefore your effective tax rate ‚Äì by claiming tax deductions for approved business expenses (üéâ).  How claiming business expenses affects your tax rate To help sole traders and small businesses keep more of their money, the IRD allows some business expenses to be claimed as tax deductions.

Here‚Äôs how it works:  You purchase a good or a service that directly relates to earning your sole-trader income You claim the cost of the expense as a tax deduction The cost of the expense is excluded from your taxable income, which reduces the income you pay tax on and lowers your effective tax rate You pay less in taxes at the end of the financial year.

According to our latest research, Kiwi sole traders spend an average of 4 hours a week and up to $372 a month managing their tax and financial admin. That‚Äôs 208 hours and $4000+ a year that could have been better spent elsewhere. To help you avoid spending precious resources on admin this financial year, we‚Äôve put together this guide on good financial practices that‚Äôll take some of the stress out of taxes. Whether you‚Äôre a tax veteran or just starting your self-employed journey, here are a few things you can do to save time and money each week, and make lodging tax as painless as possible.  Know what you need to set aside As a sole trader, there‚Äôs a lot to think about when creating a financial budget for the year ahead. Not only do you have to calculate and pay your own tax, GST, ACC levies, and KiwiSaver contributions, you also have to pay yourself, meet your financial and business goals, and set aside enough for a rainy day. Phew! Spending time now creating a budget could save you a huge headache down the line. To help you get started, we‚Äôve put together a handy list of all the things you might need to plan for: What you need to pay the IRD Let‚Äôs start by dealing with the IRD. As a sole trader, you‚Äôre responsible for:  Income Tax - your income tax rate is calculated by adding up all your sources of income (including salary and wages, self-employed income, investment income etc) before applying a standard tax rate. GST - If you earn over $60,000 per financial year from your self-employed income (i.e. not including any income from salary or wages) then you are required to register for GST. Student Loan - If you have an outstanding student loan, and you earn over the annual threshold of $21,268, then you‚Äôre required to make repayments on that loan.  What you need to pay the ACC  ACC levies - Alongside your other tax obligations, you‚Äôre responsible for calculating and paying the ACC‚Äôs three levies:  the Earner‚Äôs levy is a flat rate of $1.21 per $100 of your liable income the Working Safer levy is a flat rate of $0.08 per $100 of your liable income the Work levy is based on the industry you operate in.

The riskier your line of work, the higher this levy will be     How to plan ahead To avoid a colossal headache at the end of the year, the best time to start putting money aside for tax is now. Make sure you‚Äôll be ready when the time comes in a few simple steps: Step One: Use our Income Tax Calculator to calculate your tax rate, (approximate) ACC levies, student loan repayments, and KiwiSaver contributions  If you know exactly how much you‚Äôll make this year, our Income Tax Calculator is a simple and accurate way to calculate the amount of money you‚Äôll need to set aside. If you DON‚ÄôT know how much you‚Äôll earn, our calculator is a good starting point. Plug in your previous year‚Äôs income, and go from there. As your projections for the year change, keep revisiting the calculator to make sure you‚Äôre still on track to meet your obligations.  Step Two: Get to grips with GST  If you earn over $60,000 in self-employment income per year, you‚Äôll need to register for GST. This means charging an extra 15% for your goods and/or services that you then pass on to the IRD. GST for your services is paid by your customers, not by you.  üí° You can reduce your GST bill by claiming back the GST your business has paid when purchasing goods and services. For more information, check out our guide to GST. Step Three: Make the most of KiwiSaver contributions  If you make personal contributions to your KiwiSaver fund, you may be eligible for a government contribution of up to $521.43 annually All you have to do is contribute $1042.86 between the 1st of July and 30th of June each year That‚Äôs easy money being left on the table if you‚Äôre not taking advantage of it!  *Looking for a way to automate tax calculations?

While that‚Äôs a heck of a lot to be thinking about, our budgeting journey doesn‚Äôt stop there. Let‚Äôs look at what else you should be setting aside funds for: planned and unplanned time off work. Time spent not earning The best-laid plans of mice and men, right? Despite our best efforts to reach our business goals, life will sometimes get in the way. We need to make sure we have a rainy day fund to cover both the expected and the unexpected. Get the ball rolling on this fund by calculating the total number of days a year you might not be able to work. For example:  Public Holidays: Aotearoa celebrates 11 national public holidays, and one regional public holiday, for a total of 12 days off Personal Holidays: Are you taking a vacation this year (you absolutely should)? Do you need some time off to refresh and recharge? Give yourself some ‚Äòannual leave‚Äô and factor ‚Äòpaid‚Äô time off into your budget! Sick Leave: PAYE employees get 10 sick days a year. Even if you don‚Äôt need it, knowing you have 10 days worth of income stashed away can make falling ill less stressful. Slow Periods: Many industries have slumps in activity at certain points in the year. If you know when yours are, you can compensate by putting more aside during busy periods.  If possible, it‚Äôs always best to err on the side of caution and factor in one or two days extra, just in case of emergencies. The next step is to estimate how much money you need to set aside in order to cover these potential days off. This amount may vary by type of ‚Äòleave‚Äô ‚Äì you might want to save more to spend for a vacation than during a sick day, for example ‚Äì but at the very least, the amount you set aside should cover all your expenses for the time you take off. üìñ For more tips on planning leave, check out our guide to taking time off!

Hnry makes this easy for sole traders by automatically assigning a percentage of their income to a savings account (or wherever they‚Äôd like to send it - investments, charities, friends and family, you name it).

But you have to be careful to only claim what you‚Äôre allowed to claim - otherwise, you risk playing the IRD lottery.

Key Taxes for the Self-Employed: Income Tax Any self-employed income you earn will need to have Income Tax paid on it. There is no ‚Äòtax free‚Äô threshold in New Zealand, and therefore any income you earn as a contractor or freelancer will be taxed. IRD calculate your income tax rate by summing the total of all your sources of income (including PAYE/Salary jobs, together with self-employed income, investment income etc) and then applying their standard tax rates. The income tax rates for PAYE earners and self-employed individuals are exactly the same. GST If you earn over $60,000 per financial year just from your self-employed income (i.e. not including any Salary/Permanent income) then IRD will require you to register for GST. When you are registered for GST, you will be required to charge your customers an additional 15% on top of the cost of your goods and services, and this 15% is payable to IRD whenever you file your GST returns. If you make business purchases, the GST on any business purchases will reduce the amount of the GST you‚Äôve collected that will be payable to IRD. For more details on GST, check out our Guide to Contractor and Freelancer GST ACC Any income you make from self-employment is also subject to ACC levies. The exact cost of your ACC levies will depend on the type of work you do. If you also earn income from PAYE/Salary work, then you will already be making ACC contributions as part of your PAYE taxes, and therefore any ACC levies on your self-employed income will be in addition to that. It‚Äôs worth noting that there are annual limits for ACC levies, over which you won‚Äôt be required to make any further payments. N.B. For our calculator below, we have assumed an average ACC levy rate, given that there are many various ACC levy rates based on the type of work you do, and the associated risk. Student Loan If you currently have a Student Loan, and you are earning over the annual threshold of $20,020, you will be required to make repayments on that loan at the standard IRD rate of 12%.

Most self-employed contractors and freelancers have, at some point, felt the pain of a big, unexpected tax bill. Whether you‚Äôre a first-time sole trader or a seasoned self-employed taxpayer, the end of the tax year is a nervous time. But it‚Äôs not just taxpayers - the IRD gets nervous too. The IRD doesn‚Äôt want people to be hit with massive bills at the end of the tax year - it‚Äôs bad for tax collection, bad for cash flow. What is Provisional Tax? Provisional tax is the IRD‚Äôs tool to prevent these sorts of tax bills. The purpose of the payments is to help you, the taxpayer, avoid getting too far behind on your taxes. Provisional tax is not a separate tax. It‚Äôs income tax, paid in instalments throughout the current tax year in order to help taxpayers avoid those big tax bills. The amount of each instalment is calculated using your previous year‚Äôs earnings. For contractors or freelancers who have irregular earnings, this can create some cash flow problems. Do I need to pay Provisional Tax? If you owed tax at the end of the previous financial year, then you may be on the hook for provisional tax in the current financial year. It all comes down to how much residual income tax you owed on your 2020 tax return. If, on your 2020 tax return, you discovered that you underpaid your taxes by more than $5,000, then you will likely need to pay provisional tax during the 2021 tax year. As part of the IR3 return, you will be asked to predict your income for the forthcoming year. Be aware - getting these predictions wrong, or deliberately fiddling your provisional tax predictions can result in fines and penalties.

Be aware - getting these predictions wrong, or deliberately fiddling your provisional tax predictions can result in fines and penalties. Being subject to provisional tax means that you will need to estimate your future income, and make 3 payments throughout the financial year, on a set schedule, to ensure that you‚Äôre paying your taxes in advance When are Provisional Tax payments due? Your provisional tax due dates will depend on two things:  which payment option you choose (see below) and if you‚Äôre GST registered  The four payment options you can choose from are:  The standard option; The estimation option; The ratio option; and The accounting income method (AIM)  The standard option The standard option is the default option if you do not choose to use the estimation or ratio options; it is often the better option for those who know their income will increase over the next year. Under the standard option, provisional tax payments are calculated by taking your previous year‚Äôs Residual Income Tax (RIT), adding a 5% uplift, and then dividing by the number of instalments. The number of instalments is usually three, but if you‚Äôre registered for GST and file semi-annual returns, then you‚Äôll only pay two instalments. The estimation option If you know your income will decrease over the next year then the estimation option could be right for you. Under the estimation option, provisional tax payments are calculated by adding up all the taxable income you think you‚Äôll receive in the next year, calculating the tax on that sum, and then deducting any PAYE and other tax credits you‚Äôll be entitled to. This results in your estimated residual income tax - which is also your provisional tax for the year. As per the IRD‚Äôs website, ‚Äúif you do not think you‚Äôll have any Residual Income Tax to pay, you can estimate your provisional tax at $0.‚Äù As with the standard option, the number of provisional tax payments under the estimation option is usually three. Key Dates to Remember (for standard and estimation)  August 28: The deadline for the first provisional tax payment of the financial year.

The ratio option If you‚Äôre registered for GST and want to pay your provisional tax payments at the same time as your GST payments, then the ratio option could be right for you. However, there is some fairly strict criteria around who can and can‚Äôt use the ratio option. To use the ratio option, you must:  Have been registered for GST for the whole of the previous tax year - and part of the tax year before that! Have a Residual Income Tax greater than $5,000 from 2020. File your GST returns monthly or 2-monthly. Not have a partnership business structure Have a ratio percentage (calculated by IRD) between 0% - 100%.  Under the ratio option, you‚Äôll pay provisional tax in 6 instalments according to the schedule below. Payment dates under the ratio option  Furthermore, to use the ratio option you must let IRD know before the start of the tax year if you want to use this option. Finally, IRD will calculate the ratio percentage for you by using the information they have from your GST returns and Residual Income Tax - so this option will only work when your tax and GST returns are up to date! The accounting income method (AIM) The least common option is the accounting income method. The idea behind AIM is to prevent businesses with irregular or unpredictable income from having to make large payments at the end of the tax year. Under the accounting income method, you only pay provisional tax when your business earns a profit. For this to work, however, your business has to maintain excellent financial records. AIM uses an AIM-capable accounting software to automatically calculate your provisional tax payments for you, so this method only works as long as your financial records are up-to-date. AIM provisional tax payments are paid in three installments, whose due dates align with your GST due dates. If you file monthly GST returns, you‚Äôll pay these monthly. If you pay your GST every two or six months, then you‚Äôll make 2-monthly instalment payments.

ACC levies are collected from all New Zealanders who work or own a business. This money is then used to fund ACC‚Äôs universal coverage for injury claims for all New Zealanders, regardless of employment status. Permanent/salaried earners pay their ACC levies as part of their PAYE Income Tax. It‚Äôs all automatic, meaning that they don‚Äôt need to think or worry about ACC. But if you‚Äôre self-employed, you‚Äôll need to manually pay ACC levies in addition to your income tax, GST, and student loan payments. This is true even if you don‚Äôt earn much self-employed income, and mainly rely on your permanent/salaried role. You‚Äôre still required to pay ACC levies in proportion to your self-employed income. The three different levies For self-employed people, your ACC payment is made up of three different levies:  the Working Safer levy, a flat rate of $0.08 per $100 of your liable income  this helps fund Worksafe NZ, New Zealand‚Äôs primary workplace health and safety regulator   the Earner‚Äôs levy, a flat rate of $1.21 per $100 of your liable income  this helps funds cover for injuries that happen during everyday, non-work activities   the Work levy, which is based on what kind of business you run  this helps funds cover for injuries that happen at work the riskier your line of work, the higher this levy will be    üí° Note: the term ‚Äúliable income‚Äù refers to income that is subject to the ACC levies.

ACC sets a minimum and maximum threshold for liable income every financial year, and you‚Äôre only required to pay levies on your taxable earnings between these thresholds. You can read more about these thresholds on the ACC website. Declaring Your Industry or Type of Work This is important. Your ACC Work levy rate is based on the type of work you do, because some industries are more high-risk than others. A skydiving instructor, for example, will have a higher levy rate than a bookkeeper. When IRD passes your details to ACC, they include the Business Industry Classification (BIC) code from your tax return or GST registration. ACC then uses this BIC code to assign you a classification unit (CU). This is the code that best describes your business activity and determines your Work levy rate. If ACC doesn‚Äôt know what you do for a job then this code will default to a Manufacturing code, which has one of the highest levy rates. Paying too high a rate with ACC is one of the most common mistakes we see self-employed people make, and it‚Äôs usually because ACC assigned them the default Manufacturing code. You can check what CU you‚Äôve been assigned using the MyACC for Business website. If you need to change your CU, you can find the correct code using the Business Industry Classification Code website. If you‚Äôve already received an invoice using the incorrect CU, you‚Äôll need to contact ACC to update your account with the correct code. Wait for them to issue you a credit before paying the remaining balance. Understanding your ACC documents There are three types of documents you might receive from ACC depending on your ACC product and payment status. These documents are:  ACC CoverPlus Invoice ACC CoverPlus Credit ACC Coverplus Extra Invoice  #### Understanding your ACC CoverPlus Invoice:  Classification Unit (CU): This is the code that best describes your business activity and determines your Work levy rate. If ACC doesn‚Äôt know what you do for a job then this code will default to a Manufacturing code with one of the highest levy rates.

If you‚Äôve already received an invoice using the incorrect CU, you‚Äôll need to contact ACC to update your account with the correct code.

Wait for them to issue you a credit before paying the remaining balance (see ‚ÄúUnderstanding your ACC CoverPlus Credit‚Äù). Employment status: If you work an average of less than 30 hours per week (including both self-employed and PAYE hours), your invoice should say ‚ÄúPart-time‚Äù. In all other cases, ‚ÄúFull-time‚Äù is correct. If you‚Äôre full-time, you‚Äôll be charged levies based on the minimum income amount of $36,816, even if you earn less than this in self-employed income. If you earn over $36,816 then your levy rates will be based on your actual earnings as declared to ACC by IRD. If you work part-time you won‚Äôt be affected by the minimum income amount. ACC will base your levies on your actual liable income. Liable income: As a self-employed individual, your liable income is based on the income information you declared with Inland Revenue on the IR3 Individual income return. ### Understanding your ACC CoverPlus Credit:  This is where ACC‚Äôs system gets confusing, especially for first-time self-employed individuals. The most common misunderstanding of an ACC credit is that it means you no longer have a bill to pay - this is NOT correct. Any credit note issued is a credit against the original invoice issued to you by ACC. For example, let‚Äôs say your original invoice was for $984.77,but ACC had the wrong details for you on the invoice (e.g. Classification Unit, or Employment Status). Your first step will be to contact ACC and get those details updated. ACC will subsequently issue you a credit much like the $422.67 ACC CoverPlus Credit in the image above. This credit serves to reduce the amount owing to ACC down to $562.10 ($984.77-$422.67), which you will need to pay using the payment reference details included on the original invoice. Understanding your ACC Coverplus Extra Invoice:  You will only be on Coverplus Extra if you have arranged this directly with ACC. Coverplus Extra is a more bespoke insurance policy, based on your individual circumstances, rather than the general coverage offered by ACC‚Äôs standard Coverplus policy. üí° Note: Unlike other ACC invoices that are usually issued in September, the CoverPlus Extra invoice is issued in April.

Goods and Services Tax (GST) is an additional tax that is charged on some goods and services in New Zealand. When you buy and sell goods, you may need to charge or pay GST if you - or the person you are purchasing from - are registered for GST.

How do I show GST on my invoices? GST Calculator Quick GST Facts  How do I know if I need to be registered for GST? You are required to register for GST if you are an individual or a company that is earning over $60,000 in a single financial year. For individuals, the $60,000 threshold is only applicable to the total of their self-employed, contracting and freelancing income - therefore any PAYE/Salary income is not counted towards this total. For example:If you have a PAYE/Salary job of $50,000 per year, and you also earn $20,000 from freelance income, you are not required to register for GST If you earn less than $60,000 in self-employed income, registering for GST is totally optional. If you do register for GST voluntarily, be aware that this will have an impact on the amount that you charge for your services, and you will also be required to file GST returns on a regular basis. How does GST work? GST can be charged on top of the sales and income that you make, and you may also make purchases and incur business expenses that will have GST within the price. Here‚Äôs how it works. For Sales and Income If you are registered for GST, you will be required to charge an additional 15% on top of the costs of your services. For example:If you sold an item for $100, you would need to charge an additional $15 on top for GST, taking the total price to $115 For Purchases and Expenses If you purchase something from a person or company that is GST registered, you will pay an additional 15% on top of their prices. For example:If you bought an item costing $115 from someone who was GST-registered, $15 of the price you paid would be GST N.B. You are still required to pay the GST portion of any goods and services you purchase, even if you are not GST-registered yourself.

You are still required to pay the GST portion of any goods and services you purchase, even if you are not GST-registered yourself. It is essential that you keep accurate records of all the GST you have collected and paid throughout a GST period. This is usually done by keeping records of all invoices, receipts and transactions where GST was either collected or paid. You will need all of this supporting information when filing GST returns. How are GST returns calculated? When you are GST-registered, you are required to file GST Returns on a regular basis. This requires you to declare to IRD both the total GST you have collected on your sales/income, as well as the total GST you have paid when making business purchases. The balance of the two is then payable to IRD. For example:If over a period of 2 months, you collected $1,000 of GST on all your sales, and you made purchases of which the GST portion was $250, you would pay IRD the balance of the two - $750 In certain circumstances, you may find that within a GST period, you have paid more in GST than you have collected in GST on your sales. In these instances, you would receive a GST refund from IRD. N.B. Any GST you collect on your sales and income should be held separately pending being paid to IRD. When it comes time to file GST returns, if you do not have the GST funds available to pay straight away to IRD, you will be hit with penalties and fines. Do I need to be registered as a company to be GST-registered? No. You can register for GST as an individual contractor, freelancer or sole trader - there is no need to register a company with the Companies Office. As an individual, you can raise the same business expenses as a registered company would. N.B. You also do not need to have an NZBN number to be registered for GST. Having an NZBN is completely optional in New Zealand, and for contractors and freelancers it is often unnecessary. Read our comprehensive guide on when and how to register a New Zealand business as a contractor or freelancer. How do I register for GST?

N.B. If you‚Äôre a Hnry customer, check out our handy Guide to Registering for GST What is the difference between ‚ÄòPayments‚Äô and ‚ÄòInvoice‚Äô on a GST basis? When you register for GST, you will need to decide whether to register on a ‚ÄòPayments‚Äô or ‚ÄòInvoice‚Äô basis. Which one you choose will have a direct impact on when you will be required to pay GST - so choose carefully. The key difference between them is all about when the GST you are collecting is recognised for tax purposes, and therefore when IRD will expect payment of those GST funds. Payments Basis When you have registered for GST on a ‚ÄòPayments‚Äô basis, the date that you ‚Äòrecognise‚Äô the GST on your sales and income will be the date that you receive the money. For example:Let‚Äôs imagine that you are due to file GST returns monthly. You send someone an invoice on the 20th of February, and they pay it on the 20th of March. You would therefore declare the GST you have collected, as part of your GST return at the end of March, at which point you would be required to pay that amount to IRD Invoice Basis When you are registered for GST on an ‚ÄòInvoice‚Äô basis, the date that you ‚Äòrecognise‚Äô the GST on your sales and income will be the date that you send the invoice to your client. For example:Let‚Äôs imagine that you are due to file GST returns monthly. You send someone an invoice on the 20th of February, and they pay it on the 20th of March. You would therefore declare the GST you will be collecting, as part of your GST return at the end of February, at which point you would be required to pay that amount to IRD Therefore when you use an ‚ÄòInvoice‚Äô basis, you may end up having to pay GST funds to IRD before you have actually received them.

For registered companies this may have some benefits, however, for self-employed contractors and freelancers, it can sometimes result in cash flow issues and unnecessary stress. It is common for individual contractors and freelancers to choose a ‚ÄòPayments‚Äô basis when registering for GST. How often do I need to file GST returns? When you register for GST, you can decide how often you would like to file GST returns, by choosing from 3 different frequencies: monthly, 2-monthly or 6-monthly. How often you choose to file returns is totally up to you (although if you earn over $500,000 per year you will be unable to choose the 6-monthly filing option). Any time your GST return is due you will be required to fill out a GST return, declaring your income and expenditure to IRD. You will also be required to make any payments of GST through to IRD as soon as your return has been filed. Do I charge GST when I sell goods or services to clients who operate outside of New Zealand? Any client that operates outside of New Zealand, who has no local NZ presence is often deemed to be ‚ÄòZero Rated‚Äô for GST, and therefore you are not required to charge GST on the goods and services you sell to them. For example:If you‚Äôre a freelancer working for a company in the UK that has no trading presence in New Zealand when you invoice them, you will not charge or collect GST on that invoice N.B. You will still be required to supply a total of your ‚ÄòZero Rated‚Äô sales and income as part of your regular GST returns Do I pay GST when I buy goods and services from people who operate outside of New Zealand? Sometimes, yes. When making purchases or incurring business expenses from suppliers based overseas, you should always look carefully at the proof of purchase they provide you, to see if you have been charged New Zealand GST. This is particularly relevant when incurring subscription expenses from online software providers such as Google and Facebook. The legislation for these organisations has recently changed in New Zealand, and they are not required to charge GST on any subscription or advertising costs incurred by people in New Zealand. How do I show GST on my invoices? If you‚Äôre someone who invoices their clients in order to collect a payment, and you register for GST, your invoices are then deemed to be ‚ÄòTax Invoices‚Äô","metadata":{"id":60}}],["61",{"pageContent":" costs incurred by people in New Zealand. How do I show GST on my invoices? If you‚Äôre someone who invoices their clients in order to collect a payment, and you register for GST, your invoices are then deemed to be ‚ÄòTax Invoices‚Äô and therefore are required by IRD to feature certain things:  The words ‚ÄòTax Invoice‚Äô in a clear and prominent place Your name (or Trading Name) Your GST Number The date of the invoice A description of the goods or services you are selling  N.B.
