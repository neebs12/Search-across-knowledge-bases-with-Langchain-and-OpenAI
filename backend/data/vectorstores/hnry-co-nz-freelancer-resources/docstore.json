[["0",{"pageContent":"Times have changed. Ways of working have shifted away from siloed permanent roles, and organisations across New Zealand and the globe have embraced flexible working through contract roles.  As such, the work/life balance is becoming more and more distinct: some contractors can work from home should they choose, while freelancers can pick their own hours, adjusting their work to fit around their lives and not the other way around.  Self-employment, freelancing and contracting are commonplace, however some people are still unsure of whether being self-employed is for them. There are all sorts of myths floating around out there that really need debunking: should you register as a business; do you need to be registered for GST; what it means to have withholding tax deducted prior to payment; and so many more.  So we’ve compiled a list of the most common misconceptions about being a contractor:  Myth 1: You need to register as a limited company in order to be a contractor  Myth 2: Contracting is less secure than a permanent job  Myth 3: The tax admin is too difficult  Myth 4: There’s no career development as a contractor  Myth 5: It’s isolating and lonely being a contractor  Rapid-fire myths   Myth 1: You need to register as a limited company in order to go contracting This is probably the biggest misconception around contracting out there at the moment. For the longest time, people have been mistakenly set up as a business – perhaps advised by someone else to do so. Most people think that by registering as a business you’ll be able to pay less tax on your earnings, but the moment you take money out of the business you’ll pay tax on it on the standard individual rates.  The only surefire way to lower your tax rate is to declare expenses throughout the financial year, and actually reduce the amount of income that you’re being taxed on. Registering as a business might sound like a sly way to dodge taxes, but in the long run it may actually generate more cost and manual overhead that you’ll need to wade through. In fact, if you’re taking dividends from a company, the IRD charge 28% company tax on those dividends, and then you’re taxed an additional 5% on those earnings – bringing your tax rate up to 33% anyway. So what’s the actual advantage?  If you stop to think about the extra admin required (ie filing two tax returns), and","metadata":{"id":0}}],["1",{"pageContent":" then you’re taxed an additional 5% on those earnings – bringing your tax rate up to 33% anyway. So what’s the actual advantage?  If you stop to think about the extra admin required (ie filing two tax returns), and for what potential benefits, it becomes apparent that this approach might be overkill.  Will you be hiring staff and needing payroll services? Or will you have inventory, or be taking on creditors? Are you expecting to take on investors and eventually sell the business? When you’re just starting out as a contractor, freelancer or sole trader, setting up as a registered business is not a requirement. If you decide to take on the complexity of having a ‘small business’ you can always register that business further down the line. Going the other way however, and winding down a business once set up, can sometimes be tricky.  If you do choose to set up as a registered business you’ll end up with even more admin to do: this means two sets of tax returns - one for you as an individual, one for the business – which means two sets of expenses, two lots of paperwork, all of which adds up to an overly complex set-up. As the Director of a registered company, you’re also just as liable for the activities of that company as you would be for your activities as a sole trader.  Not only can the hassle be overwhelming, but there are also extra costs involved in registering as a business, maintaining company records, and perhaps even paying an accountant to file a tax return for your business as well as for you as an individual.  As a sole trader, you can still have a trading name and a logo. You can still have cool business cards with your name, title, logo, and trading name on them. You can still claim tax relief on your business and home office expenses, and register for GST, all without needing to register as a business.   I’ve unnecessarily registered as a business. What do I do? After you’ve ceased operating as a business, you must file a final tax return that includes your business accounts up to the date that your business ceased to operate. This indicates that your company is no longer trading. Until you’ve filed your final tax return, you haven’t completed your business tax obligations.  You’ll also have to remove your company from the register and declare to IRD that your company has been deactivated, by filling out an IR433 form.  If your company is registered","metadata":{"id":1}}],["2",{"pageContent":" tax return, you haven’t completed your business tax obligations.  You’ll also have to remove your company from the register and declare to IRD that your company has been deactivated, by filling out an IR433 form.  If your company is registered for GST, you’ll need to file returns up until the date you stop operating as a registered business, then you just need to deregister your company for GST.  Unless you’re looking to take on employees or sell your business in the near future, registering as a business will likely create a whole lot more admin for you to do, all of which is easily avoidable.   Myth 2: Contracting is less secure than a permanent job Back in the days when contracting and freelancing were less common, there tended to be a lot more uncertainty around the job market. People were cautious to leave the security of a permanent role in search of more flexible working situations.  But with the advent of the gig economy and the rise of self-employment over the last decade, it’s never been easier to earn an income independently. Roughly 15-20% of the workforce are earning income from self-employment, and independent earning – through contracting, freelance work, and sole traderships – creates a vibrant and buoyant part of the economy.  Given this rise in independent earning and the ‘gig economy’, it’s also never been easier for companies to restructure you out of a permanent job. As a permanent member of staff, you’re only one ‘restructure’ away from being made redundant. In fact, things have now got to the point where having a permanent job no longer offers the same ‘job for life’ security it once did – thus making contracting and freelancing, with the right focus on growing skills (see below), a safer option.   Myth 3: The tax admin is too difficult This is one of the main fears that many people have when contemplating the switch to a contracting role. Being self-employed does mean that all of that admin that would normally be taken care of by a permanent employer (things like taxes, payments, and ACC levies), would fall onto the individual’s shoulders. And all that admin hassle can feel like a full-time job in itself.  But with the introduction of services like Hnry, those perceived obstacles can be left in the rear-view mirror.

But with the introduction of services like Hnry, those perceived obstacles can be left in the rear-view mirror. Hnry automates the things you need done, solving the issue of the admin overhead and making it simple, accessible and affordable for anyone to earn an independent income.  When you’re freed from the hassle and confusion of the financial admin, you can focus on your work and your clients, without ever having to spend hours learning and worrying about taxes.   Myth 4: There’s no career development as a contractor This one couldn’t be further from the truth. A perceived lack of career development has always been seen as a barrier to people becoming self-employed, but with the flexible work/life balance we’re seeing more and more people take to contract and freelance work specifically because it allows them to develop new skills in their own time.  With the rise of portfolio careers, these days it’s far more common for people to have multiple skills in different areas. We call these individuals ‘T-shaped’: they have one major set of skills and then several auxiliary, or outlying, skills with which they can go out and find more work.  The ‘T-shaped’ model can be seen in such examples as the web developer who leads after-work innovation seminars and workshops, or the entrepreneur who is a yoga instructor in their spare time, or even the real estate agent who drives for Uber in the weekend.  Add to the mix the increased access to affordable online training, and it becomes apparent just how available it is for someone to upskill and grow their knowledge. In New Zealand alone there are some great organisations, such as enrichme.io and WelTec, that offer some really useful courses that help spread the knowledge. Additionally, YouTube is a great channel for tutorial videos, while platforms like Code Academy and HubSpot offer qualifications and courses online.  More and more companies are starting to treat their self-employed workers like part of the family. When you contract with a company, you’re not a commodity resource, you’re a valued member of the team, and as a contractor it can often feel as though you’re treated just like a permanent member of staff.   Myth 5: It’s isolating and lonely being a contractor This might have been the case a few decades ago, but with the emergence of video conferencing software, asynchronous communication apps, coworking spaces and online communities, it’s never been easier to work remotely or hot desk in one","metadata":{"id":3}}],["4",{"pageContent":" and lonely being a contractor This might have been the case a few decades ago, but with the emergence of video conferencing software, asynchronous communication apps, coworking spaces and online communities, it’s never been easier to work remotely or hot desk in one of the various shared locations in New Zealand alone.  In fact, lots of people are working remotely these days. These workers, often referred to as ‘digital nomads’, don’t just sit all on their own at a desk. They’re always collaborating using tools like Slack, Trello, Zoom, and Google Drive – to name a few.  And as more and more people are taking that leap into self-employment, organised events and meetups are becoming increasingly popular in communities all around the world. Engaging with one’s community is such an important part of expanding your network and meeting others in your profession. The Wellington Startup Garage, a meetup based here in Wellington, has over 3600 registered members!  Meetups have made it much easier for like-minded self-employed people to socialise; online industry-based communities such as Unicorn Factory, Freelancer Village and Design Assembly make it easy to connect with other people in your work sphere; and technological advances around ways of working have allowed us all to stay more connected, building strong connections, and perhaps even develop new opportunities that would otherwise be unavailable in permanent employment.  And with these advancements, it’s even easier for contractors and freelancers to work from home. Particularly if you have kids or parents to care for, or just generally other things on in the day, flexing your core hours can be incredibly beneficial.   Rapid-fire myths “If my client or recruiter deducts Withholding Tax, I don’t have to pay any more taxes.” This is ONLY true if that recruiter has deducted the exact right amount of tax, which NEVER happens because your actual tax rate won’t be the round number that you indicate on an IR330C. So if you only rely on your recruiter deducting Withholding Tax, you’ll always end up paying too much or too little income tax. And keep in mind that Withholding Tax is only the first part of your income tax – it doesn’t include ACC, GST, or student loan.  “I need to register a company with companies office in order to register for GST.” This is absolutely not true. You can register for GST as an individual at any time - and if you earn over $60,000 from self-employment over a","metadata":{"id":4}}],["5",{"pageContent":" “I need to register a company with companies office in order to register for GST.” This is absolutely not true. You can register for GST as an individual at any time - and if you earn over $60,000 from self-employment over a 12 month period, it will be mandatory to register for GST. Registering as a company creates a whole lot more admin for you, and is not at all needed in order to register for GST.  “I need to register for GST in order to send invoices to my clients.” Registering for GST has nothing to do with your ability to send out invoices. Your clients may ask that your invoices read ‘Tax Invoice’ somewhere on them, but there is no requirement to register for GST unless you plan to earn over $60k in a financial year. If you are GST-registered, you’ll need to adjust your hourly rates to incorporate the 15% collected in GST; but if you’re not GST-registered, you can still send invoices to your clients without collecting GST.  “If I use accounting software, I don’t need to keep my receipts for seven years.” If you have a bank account linked to your accounting software, you still need to upload receipts for all of your expenses. You still have to keep your receipts, even if you have the software hooked into your bank account - as if you ever cancel your subscription, you won’t easily be able to get access to your receipts any more. As a tax agent, Hnry is required to hold your receipts for seven years, regardless of whether you’re still an active Hnry customer. We store your expense receipts and income/tax reports in a kind of personal digital vault that you can access at any point, so you’re never beholden to a specific software.  “My accountant can stop me getting audited”. No one can stop you from being audited – not even an accountant. When it comes to your tax bill, the expenses that you’ve claimed for, and the income that you’re actually being taxed on, it’s your responsibility (and therefore your obligation) to make sure the information you provide is accurate. Otherwise, you might end up with several tax horror stories, come year-end. And in the case of an audit, your accountant can provide records to IRD but you’ll be responsible for any claims made throughout the year.  “Ahhh, I won’t get audited.” Well, what if you did?","metadata":{"id":5}}],["6",{"pageContent":"-end. And in the case of an audit, your accountant can provide records to IRD but you’ll be responsible for any claims made throughout the year.  “Ahhh, I won’t get audited.” Well, what if you did? Is being audited and getting hit with an avoidable tax bill worth it? Operating within the lines and policies of IRD is the only way to avoid getting caught. IRD aren’t spending taxpayers’ money trying to find people who are doing the right thing – they’re putting all their resources towards people who are operating at the fringes: claiming things they shouldn’t and trying to get away with it.   A World of Opportunity The truth is, contracting is not as tricky as it used to be. Hnry has made it a lot simpler to earn an income as a contractor. We automate the tax payment and filing process, provide expert support around expense claims, and provide you with real-time financial reports and planning tools. With Hnry, you can set up automatic contributions to your KiwiSaver, investment portfolios, and savings accounts, to ensure that you’re setting aside money for your future.  A lot of the challenges that used to be associated with earning independently have been solved by new technologies and services, and the shifting attitudes towards the work/life balance have given more and more people access to flexible working schedules.  Yes, there is a lot of misinformation out there, but this collection of mythbusters should hopefully provide some clarity and help empower you to go out and earn with confidence. There is a lot of opportunity in the changing landscape of work; Hnry is here to help you take advantage of those opportunities, and we’ll provide you with all of the resources you need to thrive as an independent earner. When you work independently as a contractor or freelancer, it becomes really obvious just how much your time is worth. That’s why it’s important to have the right tools, to maximise your efficiency and get the most out of your time. You also need to grow and maintain a strong network to win new clients and keep the work coming in. You can’t rely on someone else to get you your next role, so taking the time to engage with your network is essential.

Finally, you’ll need to ensure that your clients and prospective clients see you as being organised and professional, taking the time to choose tools and ways of working that ensure their precious time isn’t wasted either.  So we’ve put together a list of 5 key tools that’ll help you stay at the top of your game:  1. LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/  This may seem like an obvious one, however it’s amazing how few people are actually getting the full value out of LinkedIn. It’s not just a place to hold your job history or read articles - it can be used for so much more than that. Here are our tips for getting the most from LinkedIn:  Create and post content to your network: Upload videos, or use LinkedIn’s in-built Articles feature to publish your own content to your network. Tell people what you think, write out a list of tips, or take a stand on an issue - all of this can demonstrate your expertise in your field. Articles don’t need to be long - maybe 500 words or so - and videos should be short and to the point. If you create something engaging and original, your network will see you as someone worth listening to. Avoid creating clickbait content, vlogging from the drivers’ seat of your car or posting ‘motivational’ quotes - your network won’t thank you for it!  Monitor and maintain your network: When you meet someone in a professional situation, add them on LinkedIn - add a comment to that invitation so that people remember you. LinkedIn is a professional network, so unless you have a professional reason for connecting with someone, don’t look to add them on LinkedIn. Look out for people in your network changing jobs, as it could lead to new opportunities. Remember - the larger your network, the larger the number of people that will be able to see your activity. At least once a day, it’s really valuable to spend some time on LinkedIn, engaging with your network. You never know - it could lead to your next piece of paid work.  Comment and share content: It’s no good just reading other people’s posts - you need to be active on LinkedIn and engage with your network. That means commenting on others’ posts, share others’ content to your network, and show your network that you’re participating. LinkedIn is a two-way street - if you engage with others’ content, they’ll engage with yours.","metadata":{"id":7}}],["8",{"pageContent":" with your network. That means commenting on others’ posts, share others’ content to your network, and show your network that you’re participating. LinkedIn is a two-way street - if you engage with others’ content, they’ll engage with yours.  Keep your profile up-to-date: It’s really important that your LinkedIn profile is accurate and up-to-date. LinkedIn can be a fantastic way of showcasing your experience to potential clients and recruiters, so always make sure your job history is accurate and clear. As and when you gain new qualifications and certifications, make sure you add them to LinkedIn. Remember, it’s a place for professional qualifications - so your swimming badges probably aren’t relevant here…  2. Zapier https://zapier.com/  Zapier is a fantastic online tool to help you automate your professional life. Zapier allows you to connect one piece of software with another, triggering automated tasks (called ‘Zaps’) based on a set of rules that you define. It has an ever-growing list of different integrations, allowing you to connect tools together like Gmail, Facebook, Google Sheets, Trello, Slack, Mailchimp, Streak, Typeform and many more.  Creating a ‘Zap’ is quick and simple, and is a fantastic way of saving yourself time and effort. Our 3 favourite uses of Zapier for contractors and freelancers are:  Save new Gmail attachments to Google Drive: When you receive emails, it can be easy to forget to store those attachments in your Google Drive. That means you’re forever trying to search Gmail to find the email, and then dig out the attachment. With Zapier, you can automatically save any attachment someone emails you into your Google Drive, into a folder of your choice. Add new Google Contacts to MailChimp audiences: If you’re someone who often sends out emails to your network, providing updates on your activity, you might want to consider automatically adding any new Google Contacts to your MailChimp audience. You then simply need to add a Contact in Google, and you don’t have to worry about manually keeping your MailChimp lists up to date. Connect LinkedIn to Livestorm Webinars: Creating and publishing webinars is becoming a really useful way of connecting with your network - particularly if you have skills or experiences that others would be interested in. By using LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms you can publicise an upcoming Webinar on LinkedIn, and have each respondent registered for your Livestorm webinar","metadata":{"id":8}}],["9",{"pageContent":" useful way of connecting with your network - particularly if you have skills or experiences that others would be interested in.

But these examples are just the tip of the iceberg. Zapier lets you connect thousands of different apps together, so the possibilities are endless. Regardless of what industry you work in, or what sort of work you do, Zapier can save you a lot of time, and ensure you can focus on doing the things that are really important.  3. Streak https://www.streak.com/  If you’ve been on the hunt for a lightweight CRM tool, look no further than Streak. Streak is seamlessly integrated into Gmail - which is really important given that you probably spend most of your time in your email client! Streak allows you to manage a pipeline of leads, manage tasks, organisations, contacts, all from within the standard Gmail interface. They’ve also got really useful mobile apps, that provide that same functionality whilst you’re on the go - great for taking notes in meetings or setting follow-up tasks after the meeting.  Some of our favourite features of Streak CRM are:  Email Tracking: As standard, Streak comes with the ability for you to see when your emails have been read, where they were read from, and on which type of device. This is incredibly useful if you want to check that your recipient has read your email - as well as allowing you to see all the different places it might have been forwarded to! Streak Tasks: When using Streak within Gmail, it’s really simple to set follow-ups and reminders. These get automatically created as Google Calendar entries, to ensure you’re always on top of following up with your network. If you’re someone who often needs to follow up with emails at a later date, this is a great way of keeping your inbox clean, whilst also not forgetting those all-important follow-up tasks. Social Media Profiles: Whenever you add a new Contact in Streak, it will automatically look to fetch the latest information from LinkedIn or Twitter about that person’s profile, and add that information into Streak. That means you can easily find, connect with and maintain networks with new contacts. Template Emails: How often have you found yourself sending identical emails to contacts, or using the same paragraph over and over again in emails - thanking someone for their time or","metadata":{"id":9}}],["10",{"pageContent":". That means you can easily find, connect with and maintain networks with new contacts. Template Emails: How often have you found yourself sending identical emails to contacts, or using the same paragraph over and over again in emails - thanking someone for their time or introducing yourself? Whether it’s for a standard introductory or follow-up email, Streak has the ability for you to create custom ‘snippets’ that you can insert into your emails, to save you time when dealing with multiple clients and contacts. 4. Notion https://www.notion.so/  For anyone that deals with a lot of documents and notes, it can be really unwieldy to use tools like Google Docs, and even OneNote and Evernote can get really messy, really quickly. Notion is a fantastic tool to help take notes, keep things organised, plan tasks, publish content and even for collaborating with others.It’s fast to use, and is powerful for both beginners and advanced users alike. Here are some of the ways that freelancers and contractors are getting the most out of Notion:  Taking structured notes: When it meetings, it can be hard to take structured notes, create tables or keep things formatted nicely. Often your meeting notes consist of a sporadic set of bullet points with very little structure. With Notion, it’s easy to create tables, insert links, embed documents and even assign yourself follow-up tasks. Publishing content online: With Notion, you don’t need to pay for separate web hosting costs - any of your Notion pages can be published online at the click of a button. You can publish whole sets of interconnected pages out to the public - whether that’s sharing meeting notes, a profile of yourself, or even showcasing your work with others. Managing tasks and projects: Notion has in-built templates to help you create project plans, spreadsheets and Kanban boards quickly and easily. You no longer need to think about storing meeting notes separately from tasks and plans - Notion can bring it together all in one place. 5. Calendly https://calendly.com/  If you’re someone who offers your time out to your clients, it can be really hard to ensure meetings get scheduled only at times when you’re available. If you have multiple email addresses, (perhaps working across a few different clients) then this becomes even more tricky. Enter Calendly - a fantastic tool to help you manage across multiple calendars, and help people book times with you","metadata":{"id":10}}],["11",{"pageContent":" you’re available.

We’re not going to sugarcoat it; inflation has been especially hard on sole traders. If you’ve been feeling the cost-of-living pinch, you’re not alone.

If you’ve been feeling the cost-of-living pinch, you’re not alone. As of October 2022, 74% of sole traders say they’re eating into their savings, or saving less, and a whopping 85% are paying more for their supplies and services.  In more bad news, rates aren’t rising to keep up with increasing costs. Fewer sole traders raised their prices in the last few months than during the beginning half of this year, suggesting that we’re hitting a pricing ceiling. Worst of all half of all sole traders believe they’ve worked for less than minimum wage in the last six months.  We aren’t going to suggest that there’s a silver lining to all of this - it’s been a rough few years, and you don’t need to hear any more empty cliches/platitudes. What we have for you instead are five practical suggestions to help ease the strain of inflation on your sole trader business.  1. Automate everything you can Research shows that sole traders are only spending around half of their working week (55%) on actual work - the rest gets taken up with admin and taxes (18%), finding work (15%), and things like travel (12%). Freeing up some of this time could mean taking on more projects, or working bigger contracts, resulting in a boost to your bottom line.    Start by identifying the boring, repetitive tasks that drain your soul. For example, is chasing invoices taking up a lot of your time? Are you struggling to find new clients? At the risk of sounding like an infomercial, are taxes getting you down? Good news - there’ll be a way to either streamline that task, or automate it completely!  Once you know what you don’t want to deal with anymore, you can start finding the right solution for your needs. That could mean anything from creating a booking form on your website, to building an automatic sales pipeline in excel, to letting Hnry automatically chase clients who are late paying their invoices (politely, of course).  Automating now can mean huge time savings down the line. If you can free up just two extra hours a week, you’ll save 104 hours per year – that’s the equivalent of creating an extra two and a half working weeks a year. What could you do with that extra time?  Hnry customers save 3 hours and a week and","metadata":{"id":12}}],["13",{"pageContent":" week, you’ll save 104 hours per year – that’s the equivalent of creating an extra two and a half working weeks a year.

Here’s how: No more reconciling transactions - we do it all for you every time you’re paid into your Hnry bank account No more chasing invoices – if a client is late paying, we’ll send them a reminder email.

Claim all the deductions you’re entitled to We can’t stress this one enough: Claiming business expenses can save you thousands of dollars each year. If you’re not claiming everything you’re entitled to, that’s significant savings left on the table.  The problem is, the IRD doesn’t automatically accept every business expense as a tax deduction.  As a general rule, you can claim a tax deduction for a business expense as long as:  the expense relates directly to earning income, or running your business. This, however, is just a starting point. You should also know that:  Not every business expense will be a valid tax deduction Not every tax deduction is a business expense Some tax deductions are industry specific. A tradie won’t be able to claim everything a clown can for example, and vice versa. We know, it’s as clear as mud. So how do you know that you’re claiming everything you should claim?  The IRD website and business.govt.nz are good starting points for learning about expenses Beyond that, it’s always a good idea to talk through your expenses with an accountant (or Hnry tax specialist in the chat box below!). They might spot something you’ve missed. 💡Confused about what expenses are, what tax deductions are, and how to make the most of both? Check out our mammoth guide to tax deductions.  3. Review your cash flow If you haven’t come across this term before, it does what it says on the tin: cash flow refers to the flow of cash through your business. Unlike","metadata":{"id":13}}],["14",{"pageContent":" Check out our mammoth guide to tax deductions.  3. Review your cash flow If you haven’t come across this term before, it does what it says on the tin: cash flow refers to the flow of cash through your business. Unlike profit, which is a single number calculated at the end of the financial year (usually), cash flow factors in the timing of incoming and outgoing funds. Very simply, positive cash flow means you have more coming into your bank account than going out at any given time; negative cash flow means the opposite.  Cole runs a bakery that supplies bread to restaurants. Every month, he spends $1000 on supplies, in order to create $3000 worth of product for his clients. On the first of the month, Cole makes his usual $1000 purchase, and starts baking bread. Unfortunately, his biggest client can't pay him immediately, and instead asks to pay him one lump sum for all their bread in six months' time. For fear of losing the contract, Cole agrees. Three months later, Cole runs out of money to purchase supplies. Even though his business is profitable, because of the delay in payment, it's cash flow negative. Cole is forced to close up shop. Take a look at your business’ income and expenditure for a single month. Do the numbers balance, or do you need to make some changes? Do you need to start chasing invoices earlier? Could you renegotiate payment terms with your suppliers? If you can’t avoid negative cash flow, could your business benefit from a loan?  A higher cost of living makes tight margins even tighter. Do anything and everything you can to stay cash flow positive, and give yourself some breathing room.  4. Repackage your services As the economy contracts, raising your rates might become harder and harder to do. Everyone is trying to get the most bang for their buck, and the fear of losing work due to high prices is a real one. So how do you maintain a fair hourly rate without scaring clients away?  One strategy is to rethink what you offer, and how you price your services.  If you’re an efficient freelancer writer who charges by the hour, your hourly rate could go up if you charge per project. If you’re a tradie, you could bundle small services together into a more cost-effective package.

Take care of your mental health We know that there’s already a lot out there on mental health, so we’re going to keep this short and sweet.  1. You are your business. Your business is you. If your mental health tanks, your business will struggle. From this perspective, taking care of your mental health isn’t just essential, it’s good business sense.  2. It’s tempting to bite off more than you can chew when times get tough, but it’s not a good long term strategy. If you have to put in extra hours, do your best to create time and space to recharge. Pay attention to your own warning signs; don’t push past your limits.  3. Being a sole trader can be hard, especially when you’re just starting out. Don’t be afraid to lean on your networks, and ask for help if you need it. There are a lot of kind people out there who will gladly give you a hand, and one day you’ll be able to do the same for someone else.  4. If possible, don’t neglect the basics. Good food, enough rest, fun exercise, time with friends and family. These four things are the pillars of good mental health, and can keep you steady when things get rough.  Despite all the challenges, being a sole trader is intensely rewarding. The autonomy, freedom, satisfaction, balance - there are so many reasons why more and more people go at it alone.  If you’re struggling right now, know that it won’t last, and you’re definitely not alone.

For many self-employed tradies, understanding the tax system can be complex, time-consuming, and costly - especially if you’re trying to do it all yourself!  A few simple errors can make the end of the financial year more stressful than it needs to be, resulting in precious time lost and more taxes paid than strictly necessary. This is something we see time and time again at Hnry. Luckily, the most common missteps are easy to avoid, if you know how.  Get ahead of the curve this financial year by avoiding the top mistakes tradies make when filing their taxes.    Mistake #1 - Registering as a company Many tradies mistakenly believe that they need to register as a company to protect themselves from personal debt liability, take on bigger projects, or hire subcontractors. But this isn’t necessarily the case.  In fact, unless you’re planning to raise capital or bring on business partners, a company structure might actually leave you worse off than if you’d remained a sole trader. Here’s why:   Companies don’t necessarily protect you from personal liability for company debts As a sole trader, you are personally liable for all debts incurred. That probably doesn","metadata":{"id":16}}],["17",{"pageContent":" structure might actually leave you worse off than if you’d remained a sole trader. Here’s why:   Companies don’t necessarily protect you from personal liability for company debts As a sole trader, you are personally liable for all debts incurred. That probably doesn’t come as a surprise.  In contrast, as a shareholder of a company, you’re generally only liable for money you’ve borrowed from the company. This usually means shareholders are not personally responsible for company liabilities, and personal assets will be protected.  BUT there are a couple of scenarios where a company doesn’t provide personal protection, and personal assets are on the hook:  Personal guarantees: With small companies, it’s common for banks or suppliers to ask for personal guarantees. If a personal guarantee is in place, a company structure essentially provides no protection for personal assets. Reckless trading: Directors may be found personally liable if the company is engaging in “reckless trading.” Reckless trading is essentially running your business in a way that is likely to create a substantial risk of serious loss to the company’s creditors. Because of these exceptions, setting up a company may end up being more trouble than it’s worth in time, money, and administration.   Companies cost more to set up Setting up as a sole trader is much simpler and less expensive than setting up a company. For starters, there are no legal or registration fees whatsoever. All you need is:  your personal IRD number, any government licences and permits your business needs to operate, and any qualifications or registrations your trade requires you to have. Conversely, if you want to incorporate a company, you’ll need to:  reserve a company name ($10 + GST) apply to incorporate a company ($118.74 + GST) provide contact details for your company register for an IRD number register all your company’s directors register shares and shareholders If it’s just you owning and operating your business, registering as a company is just not worth the extra time, money, and paperwork.   Companies require more financial admin If the added fees and legwork aren’t deal-breakers for you, companies also have far more rigorous reporting requirements.  While sole traders list all their income and expenses on their personal tax returns, as a Shareholder and Director of a company, you’ll need to:  File annual company returns with the Companies Office (including the names and addresses of all Directors on their publicly-searchable register) Calculate, pay, and file company Income Tax (IR4","metadata":{"id":17}}],["18",{"pageContent":" Shareholder and Director of a company, you’ll need to:  File annual company returns with the Companies Office (including the names and addresses of all Directors on their publicly-searchable register) Calculate, pay, and file company Income Tax (IR4) returns annually These are far more complex and intensive than personal Income Tax (IR3) returns Manage company ACC levies and payments Each of these is in addition to any tax responsibilities you have as an individual. You’ll still need to manage your individual tax returns, ACC levies (where not covered by the company), and any other personal tax and compliance requirements.  In short: if you’re a sole trader, a company structure requires you to submit almost double the paperwork for little to no benefit.   Accessing money is more complicated in a company structure As a sole trader, you can draw money directly from your business account. The IRD doesn’t distinguish between personal and business funds, and there are no admin requirements.  To access company earnings, shareholders must complete a formal legal transaction. This can be done by paying wages, declaring dividends, or making personal drawings. Each of these options comes with their own paperwork and tax implications.  On top of this, if you’re not meticulously recording business expenses, valid expenses may be considered personal drawings as well.  It’s an added layer of complexity that simply isn’t necessary.    Mistake #2 - Not claiming deductions you’re entitled to Forget the proverbial receipt shoebox - you can ditch the end-of-financial-year expenses scramble by knowing what you’re going to claim ahead of time.  Self-employed tradies have a long list of deductible expenses available. Here are just a few:  Clothing Must be either protective clothing, or company-branded Equipment purchased Items under $1000 can be claimed in one go Items over $1000 must be depreciated over the life of the item Equipment hired Any rental equipment hired to complete a job Subcontractors Materials Vehicle purchases 100% claimable if the vehicle is used solely for work; otherwise you can only claim the percentage you use it for business Petrol 100% claimable if the vehicle is used solely for work; otherwise you can only claim the percentage you use it for business Logbook needed for claims over 25% Administrative expenses Phone bills Certifications Professional insurance Home office expenses Research and development expenses Professional subscriptions If something is for both business and personal use, you can only claim the business usage of the expense  Mist","metadata":{"id":18}}],["19",{"pageContent":" for business Logbook needed for claims over 25% Administrative expenses Phone bills Certifications Professional insurance Home office expenses Research and development expenses Professional subscriptions If something is for both business and personal use, you can only claim the business usage of the expense  Mistake #3 - Not setting enough aside for taxes Most sole traders experience an unexpected tax bill or shortfall in their career. To avoid getting into this situation, it’s essential that you set the right amount of money aside from every payment you receive.  To do this correctly, you’ll need to have a reasonable estimate of how much income you’ll earn in the tax year. If you have a good estimate, then any calculator worth its salt will be able to tell you how much to set aside from every payment for income tax.  But, of course, there’s more than just income tax.  On top of income tax, you also need to set aside:  2-4% of your income for ACC levies. The exact amount you’ll owe depends on your line of work - it’s higher for higher-risk occupations. 15% of every invoice for GST if you’re above the $60,000 self-employed income threshold. This is an extra charge for your client, not a deduction from your pay. 12% of every dollar you earn above the minimum threshold (currently $22,828) for student loan repayments (if you have one). contributions to your KiwiSaver account. You’ll want to make sure you’re contributing at least $1,042.86 before June 30th every year in order to receive the full government contribution of $521.43. Proactively setting aside the right amount of taxes throughout the year will give you peace of mind. No more nasty tax-bill surprises that force you to dig into your savings - or worse, default and incur penalties.

Permanent staff have the luxury of taking a holiday (or being sick) knowing they’re still getting a paycheck at the end of the week. Some employers even force them to take a holiday to use up any annual leave surpluses!  Self-employed people, on the other hand, have to relentlessly plan and save to orchestrate their holidays.  This article will guide you through my planning process for turning those holiday fantasies into realities.   The dreaded wedding invitation  How do you feel when you receive an invitation to an overseas wedding?  Is it dread? Joy?  Perhaps you feel happy because your best mate has found lasting love, but nauseated thinking about how you are going to take a week off work to fly to their wedding. And of course, you HAVE to go - after all, they took a week off to attend yours.  The feelings self-employed people feel in these situations come from several places:  Worry about going a week with no income coming in Concern about finding cover for your current work project Wondering how one can actually relax and take a break Many people go into business for themselves so that they can be in charge of their own work hours, be their own boss and have control over where they work. But the reality is that once you are fully in business for yourself, it’s sometimes easier said than done. While you may be good at building a business and structuring your own time, if you fail to also structure in holiday time then your work-life balance will really suffer.  Losing income is probably the biggest barrier to taking time away from work. Most of the self-employed people I know earn a good rate, but only when they are working. If they take time off, the income tap is also turned off.

Or they may only manage to pay themselves a greatly reduced amount while they are away - and therefore are deterred from taking the time off for themselves.  As with many things, a little forward planning can give you the freedom to plan time off and get paid while you are doing it.   Don’t wait for the wheels to fall off  Self-employed people can sometimes get tunnel vision when it comes to their career or business. The drive I see in some of my peers is inspiring. But, when that drive takes control and digs into their social or family life, I find it really concerning.  As humans, we can only maintain frantic momentum for so long. Eventually, your energy will dissipate and you will have to recharge your batteries.  The problem is, we often don’t realise our batteries are drained until the motor stops running. So even in the earliest days of working for yourself, you should be thinking about planning future time off.  Don’t wait for the wheels to fall off - get a plan in place now.   Planning a plan  Before you can get a plan in place, you need to prepare. Here are the things you should be thinking about.  1. Get buy-in from your partner or family  If you have a partner or a family, it’s essential you get them on board with planning your downtime. Fortunately, these discussions can be great for team bonding.  What family events (weddings, group getaways) are planned for the following year? What do you want to achieve with a holiday? Do you want to escape from the city, or get some time at home to do some DIY?  2. Pencil in some ideas on a calendar  It really helps to get some marks made in next year’s calendar - preferably a calendar that fits onto a single page. This really helps you visualise the ebb and flow of that year’s events before making any commitments. At this stage, you should have in mind if you want to spread your holiday out throughout the year or take it all at once (or somewhere in between!).  3. Consider your work commitments and schedule  Then think about your work schedule. When is your quiet time? If you have one, that’s obviously the time that you want to schedule your holiday break - if possible. If you don’t have one, then the best you can do is look to avoid your busiest times","metadata":{"id":21}}],["22",{"pageContent":" schedule. When is your quiet time? If you have one, that’s obviously the time that you want to schedule your holiday break - if possible. If you don’t have one, then the best you can do is look to avoid your busiest times of the year.  Regardless, the best time of your work calendar may not coincide with your ideal holiday plans, so you are going to need to compromise with what your business needs and what your friends and family need, but that is why you need to sit down and plan it out well in advance so that you can meet everyone’s expectations as best you can.   If you write it down it’s more likely to happen  When it comes to work, we are programmed to plan relentlessly. This can be taken to extremes; I know some people who plan their work years in advance!  So why not apply this madness to your personal life?  I suggest starting small to help me prove this point. Put some lunch dates in your calendar for next week (or your next earliest available lunch opening!) and watch what happens. Because it’s in your calendar, you’ll automatically start to structure your working week around them.  This is my point – unless you actually create a calendar event, it’s just not going to happen.  Now let’s turn back to the bigger holiday picture.  If you just….BOOK a holiday - Flights, hotels, etc - then those details will, through the miracle of technology, automatically be added to your calendar! And once that holiday is in your calendar, you’ll automatically start planning your workload and life around those dates.   Next - notify your clients!  This is important.  If you have clients or regular customers, you MUST help them understand that you will be unavailable on these dates.  My husband, a freelance graphic designer, does this incredibly well. His quiet time is around Christmas because a lot of his clients are on leave themselves. In the months leading up to December and January, he asks them what their work schedule is looking like during that time and lets them know exactly when he will be on leave himself.  He also sets clear expectations. He tells them that:  He will be taking a break from work and won’t be available He gives his specific leave dates… My last day of work is X. I will return to work on Y. He asks them to plan accordingly in the leadup so he can complete any high-priority work prior to his leaving For","metadata":{"id":22}}],["23",{"pageContent":"’t be available He gives his specific leave dates… My last day of work is X.

He asks them to plan accordingly in the leadup so he can complete any high-priority work prior to his leaving For some clients he tells them he will be checking his emails once a day at a specific time and if there is anything very urgent he will act on it. As a self-employed person, you sometimes have to do this to maintain communication with key customers. If you **can **avoid doing this, great! Because he sets the scene so well it is rare for his clients to need him while he is away. Your clients, too, will understand that you need to take a break and if you keep them fully involved in timeframes, they will adjust their own work diary to accommodate yours.   The important bit: getting paid when you are on holiday  It’s all very well taking time off, but how on earth do you continue to pay yourself while you are gone? Concerns about income is a huge factor that stops many self-employed people from taking a break.  But if you’re proactive you can easily plan for this.  This is where planning ahead for your holidays really pays off. Once you have it in the calendar, set up a “Travel” savings account and, in the 6-12 months leading up to that holiday, you automatically pay into that savings account.  This is basically what employers already do for their permanent staff.  You can use that money to replace the income you lost, or simply to pay for the holiday. Even better, you can keep this savings account going all the time, even when you don’t have any holidays planned. Then, when time off is required, you can simply draw down on this money and your “paycheque” can continue on uninterrupted.   Budgeting for annual and sick leave  Let’s say that in total you will give yourself four weeks of annual leave a year.  For those of you who use the Hnry service, you can set up an allocation to automatically deduct a percentage of your income every time you get paid into your Hnry Bank Account. As a rough percentage, you would simply take 4 weeks and divide it by 52 weeks, which is about 7.7%. Setting aside 7.7% from each pay into an ‘Annual Leave’ savings account would give you a solid buffer to take leave and be able","metadata":{"id":23}}],["24",{"pageContent":" take 4 weeks and divide it by 52 weeks, which is about 7.7%. Setting aside 7.7% from each pay into an ‘Annual Leave’ savings account would give you a solid buffer to take leave and be able to replace your income.  If you don’t work on percentages, then you’ll need to take a fixed payment approach. First, work out what you pay yourself each week. Chances are that as a self-employed person this income is variable; if that’s the case, work out the average weekly pay you have been receiving. Let’s say your average income over four weeks is $4,000. That’s the income you need to replace for your annual leave.  You can then work out the fixed amounts for how much you need to save every week. Divide $4,000 by 52 weeks in the year, which gives you the amount of $76.92 per week. Create a weekly automatic transfer of that small amount into your ‘Annual Leave’ bank account. And now just sit back and watch it grow, knowing that 12 months from now you can begin to take your annual leave, much like you would if you were an employee.  You can use similar formulas to set money aside for sick leave as well.  This simple structure is called a sinking fund and they are an excellent way to save up in advance for costs that you know are coming up. It eliminates the budget strain you can feel at the time of a financial event.  Remember, you are your business’s biggest asset. If you worked as an owner-operator of a truck, delivering important goods up and down the country, then you would take a lot of care to keep that machine running in top condition 100% of the time. You would spend a lot of time and money conducting regular maintenance on your key asset, your truck.  As a self-employed person, YOU are your business’s key asset. So make sure that you are setting money aside to maintain your own health and wellbeing.   Sit back and relax  Congratulations! You’ve got a plan in place:  The ‘annual leave’ bank account is growing ✅ Annual leave dates are booked into your calendar well in advance ✅ Clients are fully aware of your annual leave dates ✅ The family are looking forward to the holidays you have planned ✅ When you reach that 12-month point you know that you now have that cash cushion in your business, enough money built","metadata":{"id":24}}],["25",{"pageContent":" ✅ Clients are fully aware of your annual leave dates ✅ The family are looking forward to the holidays you have planned ✅ When you reach that 12-month point you know that you now have that cash cushion in your business, enough money built up to safely take a holiday and your paycheque does not change. Plus you know that this fund will continue to replenish itself over time.  That should give you a huge sense of security. It also should really help with the financial planning you do in your personal life as well. You know that you still have income coming in to cover all of your expenses at home and you know that you are now living a more balanced life.  So sit back, relax, and be at peace. Being a freelancer has a lot of perks - more freedom, more autonomy, and complete control over what work you take on (and who you work with). But there are, of course, drawbacks. One of those drawbacks is not having an employer to make KiwiSaver contributions on your behalf.   New Zealand employers are obligated to contribute at least 3% to each employee’s KiwiSaver fund - provided they meet certain requirements. But freelancers don’t have that employer/employee relationship to lean on for retirement funding.  This makes it all the more important for freelancers to know the ins and outs of KiwiSaver - so you can get the best possible start on saving for retirement.  This guide is designed to help you understand how to use KiwiSaver as a freelancer and get the most out of it.  In this guide we will cover:  Common mistakes first-time KiwiSaver contributors make What is KiwiSaver? What to consider when setting up your KiwiSaver account Added benefits for Kiwisaver investors So let’s get started!   Mistakes first-time KiwiSaver contributors make It’s easy to make mistakes with your KiwiSaver - especially when you don’t know how it works or have any financial plans in place. Here are some of the biggest mistakes freelancers make with their KiwiSaver:  Mistake #1: Not signing up to KiwiSaver sooner. One of the first things you’ll do in a new PAYE job is set up your KiwiSaver. Freelancers don’t have that prompt, they have to do it on their own - and many fail to sign up soon enough. Compound interest (Einstein","metadata":{"id":25}}],["26",{"pageContent":" things you’ll do in a new PAYE job is set up your KiwiSaver. Freelancers don’t have that prompt, they have to do it on their own - and many fail to sign up soon enough. Compound interest (Einstein’s eighth wonder of the world) needs time to work its magic, so every year you put it off represents a big setback in your retirement savings.  Mistake #2: Not knowing where your money is being invested. Your KiwiSaver savings could be sitting in a default/conservative fund, with over 20 years to go until you need to withdraw it, earning you minimal to no returns. Or even worse, they could be invested in products you don’t support or believe in such as weapons, alcohol and tobacco, animal testing, or something else you’re morally opposed to.  Mistake #3: Not contributing enough. A lot of freelancers treat their KiwiSaver like it’s an expense and not an investment. Making a bigger contribution now means you’re going to be better off in the future. And just by putting a minimum of $20 a week into your KiwiSaver account means you’ll be entitled to the full government contribution (see below). That’s an extra $521 per year for free - and who doesn’t like free money?  Mistake #4: Paying too much tax on your KiwiSaver (or not enough). Your Prescribed Investor Rate (PIR) is used to work out how much tax you pay on your investment earnings - in this case, your KiwiSaver earnings. Making sure your PIR is correct on your KiwiSaver account can help you avoid unnecessarily overpaying your tax, or worse underpaying your tax - resulting in an unexpected tax bill.  So, how do you avoid these mistakes? Just by knowing the basics of KiwiSaver - let’s get started!   What is KiwiSaver? KiwiSaver is a government-created scheme that was started to help all New Zealanders save towards their retirement. KiwiSaver first started in 2007 and has now grown to have over 3.1 million Kiwis enrolled across 28 different providers (and more popping up every year). KiwiSaver is an investment where you choose which KiwiSaver Scheme provider you want to invest your savings with, which you can change at ANY time. Each provider has a list of","metadata":{"id":26}}],["27",{"pageContent":"28 different providers (and more popping up every year). KiwiSaver is an investment where you choose which KiwiSaver Scheme provider you want to invest your savings with, which you can change at ANY time. Each provider has a list of funds you can choose from to invest your savings in which range from low-risk conservative fund types to higher-risk growth fund types (more on this later).  If you’re a PAYE employee, then your contributions to KiwiSaver will be matched by your employer. But if you’re self-employed, then your contributions to KiwiSaver won’t be matched by an employer, but the government will contribute a little bit annually (as long as you’re reaching certain contribution levels).  You also - in certain situations - have the option to withdraw your KiwiSaver savings. One of the most common situations is withdrawing your KiwiSaver savings to go towards the purchase of your first home (more on that below). There are other situations where you can also withdraw your savings, such as: moving permanently overseas; financial hardship; or serious illness. Kiwisaver withdrawals for these are only approved on a case by case basis - so it’s best not to treat your KiwiSaver account like a savings account if you’re looking at using those savings for anything other than your first home or retirement.   Contribution Rates: How much should you save? The standard contribution rates for KiwiSaver on a salaried job include 3%, 4%, 6%, 8%, or 10% (or more if you choose to make further voluntary contributions). How much of your pay you put towards KiwiSaver really depends on your budget and your financial goals (but more on that later).  You can set or change your contribution rate at any time; most commonly this will occur when you open your KiwiSaver account or start a new job.  If you’re self-employed, then you decide how much you want to contribute and on what basis - there are no minimum or maximum amounts with self-employment. You can also choose to contribute to your fund directly through the IRD!  If you’re a Hnry customer, then contributing to your KiwiSaver is super easy.

What to consider when setting up your KiwiSaver account There’s a lot to think about when it comes to setting up your KiwiSaver account, but here are the three main things you’ll need to consider before investing your savings:  Choosing a KiwiSaver provider Working out your financial goals and risk appetite to help you decide what investment type is right for you Choosing which fund or mix of funds you want to invest in  Firstly - How do you choose a provider? KiwiSaver providers vary from each other, so it’s important to know what you’re looking for and do some research before choosing one.  You will find a lot of providers are doing some extraordinary things that make them stand out from the crowd, such as: having socially responsible investment funds; having investments in New Zealand companies and property; donating part of their fees to charity, and supporting Kiwi research and innovations.  Some people aren’t particular about what provider they choose, but choose based on what fund(s) they want to invest in. That’s okay too - to find the fund that’s most appealing to you and simply go with the provider who manages that fund.  Regardless, choosing the right provider is all about the time you have to invest and your values. So take some time, do the research, and find out what KiwiSaver provider best suits you. You can find an entire list of them here.   Then - establish your financial goals and/or risk appetite Before you can select what fund(s) you’re going to invest in, it is essential that you understand and decide on two things: your financial goals and your risk profile.  1. What are your financial goals? What are you going to be using your KiwiSaver on first? Is it solely for retirement? Or do you plan on using it to help purchase your first home? And what is your timeline for that goal? Knowing what your financial goals are for your KiwiSaver savings and how much time you have until you’re wanting to withdraw it, will help you figure out what investment type may be right","metadata":{"id":28}}],["29",{"pageContent":" first home? And what is your timeline for that goal? Knowing what your financial goals are for your KiwiSaver savings and how much time you have until you’re wanting to withdraw it, will help you figure out what investment type may be right for you.  If you’re looking to use your KiwiSaver savings in the next 0-3 years because you have a big expense on the horizon, then a defensive or conservative fund might be best to save you from any losses if the markets were to fall.  If your timeframe is around 5-9 years a balanced fund could be your best option, so you can get some good returns but also not make any major losses.  If your timeframe is over 10 years, then a growth fund could be best suited for you - maximising your returns over a longer time period.  But these are general guidelines; your situation or your risk profile might be different.  2. What is your risk profile? The second thing you need to think about is how comfortable you are with taking risks - and I’m not talking about swimming with sharks or jumping out of a plane risk. This is determining your appetite for how much financial risk you’re willing to bear to make bigger returns. Finding out how comfortable you are at potential risk and return is important when choosing a KiwiSaver fund to invest in.  If you’re not comfortable with small rises and falls in your savings value then you may be best suited to a defensive and conservative fund. These have a lower risk and but also a lower expected return with only small movements in the value of the fund. If you’re comfortable with taking a moderate amount of risk then a balanced fund could be right for you. They have a slightly higher risk than conservative funds but have more moderate expected returns with only moderate rises and falls in the value of the fund. If you’re okay with taking bigger risks to aim for a bigger return a growth or aggressive fund is a riskier fund but has a higher expected return with significant rises and falls in the value of the fund. At the end of the day, it’s up to you, and no one else, to decide what type of fund you want your KiwiSaver savings to be invested in - as this is your money.

Take some time, do your research and figure out what you want out of your KiwiSaver savings and what fund is going to help you achieve this.   Lastly - find the right KiwiSaver funds for you Once you understand how you want to invest your money, you’re ready to choose your KiwiSaver fund!  But first, let’s answer an important question.  What is a Kiwisaver fund? Most non-cash KiwiSaver funds are composed of stocks and bonds from hundreds (sometimes thousands) of companies. When you put money into a fund, you’re buying a very small amount of each of those companies. Think about it as buying a packet of jelly beans. You’re not expecting to open the packet and find just one colour of jelly beans, you’re getting a mix of different colours, and percentages of those colours.  KiwiSaver funds are made up of two main asset types - income assets, such as bonds (conservative funds), and growth assets such as shares (growth funds), with some having a mix of both income and growth assets (balanced funds). Take a look at your own KiwiSaver fund and you’ll be able to see a wide range of different companies that you’re investing in.  That range of investments is called diversifying, and it reduces your risk. Basically, if one of the companies in your fund suddenly declared bankruptcy, your KiwiSaver wouldn’t take a huge loss as long as that company comprises only a small percentage of your fund’s investments.  Sorted.org has a great quiz you can take to compare providers, the funds they have to offer, with the amount of risk you’re willing to take!  The two most common points of comparison for funds are their fee structure and type of management.  Management type This refers to how the fund’s investments are managed.  Passive management means the investments are automatically selected based on certain criteria (e.g. the 50 biggest stocks on the NZ stock exchange). Passively managed funds tend to change very little over time, and there is no person or group devoted to choosing the investments that are part of that fund.  Active management means the investments are selected by fund managers behind the scenes. The fund managers and people investing in their funds believe that they can get an edge on the market by constantly adjusting what investments go into the fund.  Fee structure Another difference","metadata":{"id":30}}],["31",{"pageContent":".  Active management means the investments are selected by fund managers behind the scenes. The fund managers and people investing in their funds believe that they can get an edge on the market by constantly adjusting what investments go into the fund.  Fee structure Another difference to look for is the fee structure. Ultimately, this all boils down to one question: how much is this fund going to cost you in the long run?  The fees can come from a few different places:  Management fees - a percentage fee (assessed monthly or annually) based on the amount of money you have invested Administration/Membership fees - a fixed membership fee assessed monthly or annually Performance fees - a percentage fee based on the earnings of the fund (this usually applies to actively managed funds) In general, the more active a fund’s management, the more it will cost to invest in.  Choosing a fund Now that you know what you’re looking for, it’s time to choose a fund. What you’re looking for is a fund that meets all of your criteria:  Aligns with your goals and risk profile (conservative, aggressive, or somewhere in between) Meets your fee expectations Has the type of management you’re looking for Along with whatever other criteria you want to throw in, such as ethical criteria, geographic criteria, or anything else.    Added benefits for Kiwisaver investors There are some additional perks that come from being a KiwiSaver investor, including free money!  Free money - the government contribution Everybody likes free money right?  Well, for freelancers who don’t have employer contributions, the government contribution is a good boost for your KiwiSaver. As long as you contribute $1042.86 of your own money into your KiwiSaver each financial year (between 1 July to 30 June), then the government will contribute an additional $521.43 into your account!  That’s as little as contributing around $20 a week into your KiwiSaver account!  Even if you don’t make the full $1042.86 contribution, the government will still give you 50 cents for every $1 you put into your KiwiSaver account, up to that maximum of $521.43. However, you must be living in New Zealand and be over the age of 18 and under the age of 65 to be eligible for the government contribution.

However, you must be living in New Zealand and be over the age of 18 and under the age of 65 to be eligible for the government contribution.   Benefits for first-home buyers If you’re a first-home buyer, then you can apply to your KiwiSaver provider to withdraw almost all of your KiwiSaver account to go towards the purchase of that house. Provided you qualify for the first-home buyer withdrawal, your provider will be obligated to allow the withdrawal to occur.  Keep in mind, however, that it can sometimes take more than 10 business days for your provider to process the withdrawal, so you need to ensure that your settlement date gives you enough time to get that application processed.  The other great benefit is the government can also help by putting money towards your deposit for your first home as well - this is called the First Home Grant. As long as you’ve been contributing to Kiwisaver for three years and meet the income requirements, you could be entitled to up to $5,000 ($1,000 per year you’ve contributed to KiwiSaver, to a maximum of 5 years).  If it’s a new build, then you could be entitled to a grant of up to $10,000 ($2,000 per year you’ve contributed to KiwiSaver). If you’re also buying a house with a partner/friend/family member who is also in KiwiSaver, they may also be able to receive this grant.  Hnry is also making this easy for freelancers to secure a mortgage. As part of the service, you get access to payslips for every payment that comes through your Hnry account. Without being in a salaried job you don’t get the benefit of payslips and therefore it’s hard to prove to the bank that you have a stable income. With Hnry, each time you get paid we automatically send you your very own payslip that is recognised by IRD and ASB. We can even provide financial income reports to help you prove to the bank that you have a steady income and can make those repayments on your mortgage.

Not only are they able to help you make sense of everything KiwiSaver, but they can help you with your financial goals and put a plan in place to help you achieve this - particularly if you’re wanting to buy that first home sooner or you want a luxurious retirement. They will put you on the right path and help you make those tricky decisions when it comes to where to invest your money and how much risk you should be taking.  Keep in mind, however, that the final decision is always yours. It’s down to you to make the investment choices that are best for you.   Conclusion The more you know about KiwiSaver and how it all works the better you’re going to be financially in the long run - and the sooner you start, the better off your investment is going to be once you hit retirement age - or when purchasing your first home.  Being equipped with the right tools and knowledge, you can now go and make an active decision as to which provider and fund(s) to invest with to build some financial momentum. Whether you’ve actively crafted one or not, you already have a personal brand. People hear your name and think of certain things, feel specific things, and make relevant associations about who you are, what you do, and what you’re all about. On your birthday, do gifts that you receive generally follow the same theme? Maybe they’re all gardening-related or cat-themed?  That is your personal brand in action.  Cats and gardening have become associated with you. When people see cat memorabilia in the store, they think of you. And when someone wants cat-specific recommendations, you’re the go-to.  These kinds of associations can be powerful. This is especially true when it comes to your personal brand as a freelancer. The amazing thing about your personal brand though, is that you have complete power to shift and direct it to create a picture of you and your business that conveys exactly who you are, what you do, and what you’re all about.

The act of shaping this image of you, is branding.  By the end of this article, you should know how to intentionally craft a personal brand that accurately represents you, gets you more clients, and helps you grow your business.  Here’s what we’re going to cover:  What is a personal brand? Why you need to build a personal brand as a freelancer How to build a personal brand What to communicate in your personal brand The 10 key elements of a successful personal brand Where to start when it comes to building your brand First, let’s get clear on what a personal brand is.  What is a personal brand? Marty Neumeier describes a brand as:  a person’s gut feeling about a product, service, or company.  Essentially, it’s all about what people think of you when they hear your name, see your work, or encounter your brand. It’s how they’d describe you to a friend or colleague, and how they feel when they do so.  As a freelancer, people might think of you as “the branding designer who specializes in logotypes with an eclectic aesthetic and a super fun client experience.”  That’s your personal brand.  Or maybe people know you as “the technically-minded content writer for Software as a Service (SaaS) companies who is really easy to communicate with and is all about featuring diverse examples in your case studies.”  Or perhaps you’re “a wedding photographer with a glamorous style who is recognized for the magical way that you edit your photos and the unique metallic colours in your logo.”  Whatever you do and whatever you’re about, a personal brand is all about getting known, recognised, remembered and referred by the right people, in the right way.  Now let’s talk about why you need a personal brand.  Why you need to build a personal brand as a freelancer Personal branding isn’t just one of those buzzwords that people throw around for the sake of it. In fact, it’s the key to building and growing your freelance business; it’s the difference between being seen as a hobbyist and a professional; it’s one of the best investments you can make in yourself and your business.  Let me show you why.  1.

Whatever industry you’re in, there will","metadata":{"id":34}}],["35",{"pageContent":" you why.  1. You’ll stand out more There are a million and one freelancers out there, especially now that more of the world is embracing the freedom and flexibility of the self-employed life. Whatever industry you’re in, there will be many others freelancing in that same arena, and often in the same location as you. So how on earth are you supposed to compete in an industry full of other designers, writers, photographers, and other freelancers?  Now, I don’t point this out to freak you out, I promise! I say this to highlight the importance of the solution.  Personal branding.  The key to standing out in a sea of freelancers is to build a personal brand that helps you shine as the unique, amazing person that you are and carve out a specific niche for yourself!  Take Meg Lewis for example! Meg is a designer, comedian, performer, and educator working to make the world a happier place, and her brand stands out like nothing else in the sea of freelance designers out there.  Meg owns who she is, embraces the things she loves, and has created a bold, fun, hilarious brand that makes her so much more distinct and memorable than many other designers. (Trust me, if you can’t tell from the screenshot below, follow her and you’ll see!)    Meg Lewis’ hilarious and unique personal brand helps her stand out!  2. To grow your network While around 30% of freelance work comes from referrals, and you likely have returning clients on your roster, not all clients will discover you that way, and relying on referrals alone is a recipe for disaster. In fact, one of the top freelance mistakes you want to avoid is assuming work will come to you. Instead, you should always be thinking about growing your network and increasing your brand visibility.  And one of the best ways to do that is by cultivating your personal brand.  If you want to grow your freelance business through networking, then a well-established personal brand is going to help you throughout the whole process. Not only will it help you get more referrals, get mentioned online, and get asked to speak at events - it will also help you make a strong, confident, clear impression when you are networking.  With personal brand, first impressions are everything. When you meet somebody for the first time, you should be able to explain clearly what you do and show your passion for it. Even better if you can hand them a","metadata":{"id":35}}],["36",{"pageContent":" impression when you are networking.  With personal brand, first impressions are everything. When you meet somebody for the first time, you should be able to explain clearly what you do and show your passion for it. Even better if you can hand them a beautifully branded business card with your name, title, and a web address on it.  It’d feel a LOT better than floundering not knowing how the heck to describe what you do, giving them the email address you set up when you were 12 and asking them to email you so you can send them some JPEGs of your work, right?  With a clear, creative, and consistent brand, you’ll feel SO much better networking, and others will feel confident in connecting and recommending you which will help you grow that network! That’s an all-round win-win when it comes to networking!  3. To connect with the right clients When you know where you came from and where you’re going, decisions become easier. You know which clients are a good fit and which ones are not. You have a way to filter options and make decisions that will get you to where you want to go without compromising on your values.  –Bernadette Jiwa  Now when we talk about networking and booking more clients, it’s not just about getting any old client to come through your sales pipeline - it’s about getting the right clients.  Why would you battle through an inbox full of irrelevant projects from mundane or sketchy clients when you could be attracting dream projects from your dream clients? I can tell you which I’d prefer!!  The way to ensure that is through a clear personal brand that speaks directly to that dream client while communicating:  what you do, the type of projects you love, and what you value in a client relationship A vague, inconsistent, confusing brand will do the opposite of that, and you’ll be inundated with random requests for logo designs from clients or brands that give you the willies.  4. To become known as an expert Your expertise is your key to capturing the attention of your dream clients - and landing them when they enquire. You want to become known as the go-to person for your specific skill in your particular industry who people trust and recommend consistently.  This, too, is part of your personal brand.  Let’s check out Kaleigh as an example.  Kaleigh Moore is a freelance writer for eCommerce and SaaS companies who has built a personal brand","metadata":{"id":36}}],["37",{"pageContent":" who people trust and recommend consistently.  This, too, is part of your personal brand.  Let’s check out Kaleigh as an example.  Kaleigh Moore is a freelance writer for eCommerce and SaaS companies who has built a personal brand as an expert at results-driven writing for these types of businesses. Companies like Forbes, Vogue Business, and Shopify turn to her for expertly-written content; aspiring writers look to Kaleigh for advice and expertise.  Her website, social media, and past clients all work together to create a personal brand that establishes her eminence so that future clients can see that she is the person to work with if you’re an eCommerce or SaaS company that wants blog content that gets results.    Kaleigh Moore’s personal brand and website establish her as an expert.  5. To build trust As I mentioned with Kaleigh, trust is a huge part of being a successful freelancer. Whether you’re working on gaining new clients or building freelance client loyalty, it’s all about trust.  You see, the process that someone has to go through in order to buy from you is simple: Know, Like, Trust.  First they’ll find and get to KNOW you Then they’ll start to LIKE you Finally, they’ll TRUST you This can all happen quite quickly, as a potential client finds your profile, browses your website, and reads testimonials, for example. But they won’t buy your services until they feel they can trust you with their money, their time, and their business.  A strong personal brand can build that trust in seconds by presenting you as a professional, quality, trustworthy business.  If people like you they will listen to you, but if they trust you, they’ll do business with you.  –Zig Ziglar   How to build a personal brand So, now that you know why building a personal brand is important, let’s talk about how you do that.  Building a personal brand is, in essence, pretty straight-forward. All you need to do is follow these three steps:  1. Decide what you want to be known for Brainstorm and clarify:  Who you are What you do Who you do it for How you do it What value you add The feeling/s you evoke 2. Make that clear everywhere It takes 5–7 impressions for someone to recognise your brand, so you’ve gotta get your brand applied across all of your touchpoints.

Make that clear everywhere It takes 5–7 impressions for someone to recognise your brand, so you’ve gotta get your brand applied across all of your touchpoints. Apply messaging and visuals that represent your answers from step one on all of your brand touchpoints such as your:  Website Social media profiles Email signature Printed materials (flyers, business cards, posters, etc) Documents (Pricing guides, invoices, proposals, contracts, etc) 3. Communicate consistently Being consistent with your branding makes you 3–4 times more likely to experience brand visibility (a.k.a more people will know who you are) and that can result in 33% more income, so it’s actually true when people say that consistency is key. So whenever you are updating your website, creating content, communicating with a potential client, or representing your brand in any way, be consistent in how you do that, both visually and through your copywriting.  What to communicate in your personal brand Your personal brand is all about communicating to your audience and potential clients who you are, what you do, why you do it, what you’re about, and what it’s like to work with you. There are four main aspects of your brand that are key to communicating these.  1. Vision, mission, values At the heart of every good idea or great business is a clear sense of purpose and a vision for the future its creator wants to see.  –Bernadette Jiwa  These three branding basics are all about clarifying and communicating the essence of what you do. Here’s how you can think about them:  Vision: Why (The big picture, deeper reason why you do what you do) Mission: What (What it is that you do, for who, and the value you provide) Values: How (How you conduct business while working on your mission & vision) Get clear on all three, and you’ll have the foundations of a strong brand strategy.  2. Your story If you don’t give the market the story to talk about, they’ll define your brand’s story for you.  –David Brier  Every single person’s story is SO unique, and everything that has happened in your life has made you the person and the freelancer that you are today. That’s why it’s so important to know and share your story.

That’s why it’s so important to know and share your story.  You could start with these questions:  Were you creative as a child? What got you into the industry you’re in now? What made you fall in love with your passion? What made you start freelancing? What drives you? What education/jobs did you have beforehand if any? Are you trained or self-taught? What did you learn from that process & how has it influenced how you freelance? Use these as a starting place to uncover the magic of your story - delve deeper and ask your own questions along the way too!  Answering questions like these gives your audience insight into who you are, why you do what you do, and what sets you apart from others.  3. Your unique selling point Distinctiveness often requires boldness, innovation, surprise, and clarity, not to mention courage.  – Marty Neumeier  Branding is all about standing out and differentiating yourself from the others in your industry. Think about what it is that sets you apart from the crowd. Is it your:  Skills Clients Background Experience Personality Strengths Philosophy Framework/methods Beliefs Process Really think about this and get specific. Don’t just say, “my experience.” What exactly is it about your experience that makes you different from all the other freelancers in your industry? And maybe it’s a combination of a few things!  4. Your personality Last but not least, as a freelancer who works directly with clients, your brand is about you, so make it yours! People connect with people, so don’t be afraid to open yourself up to your clients. YOU are the defining part of your personal brand, so be yourself, tell personal stories, embrace your personality, and go all in on you.  Being authentically yourself will make freelancing and building a personal brand so much more fun and enjoyable for you, and will make the experience even better for your clients.  If you’re always trying to be normal you’ll never know how amazing you can be.  –Maya Angelou   The 10 key elements of a successful personal brand Branding can get a lot more complicated and in-depth than this, and span across many more elements, but for now, as long as you are clear, creative, and consistent with","metadata":{"id":39}}],["40",{"pageContent":" Angelou   The 10 key elements of a successful personal brand Branding can get a lot more complicated and in-depth than this, and span across many more elements, but for now, as long as you are clear, creative, and consistent with these 10 elements, you will have all the essentials of a successful brand.

I always say that branding isn’t a one-and-done thing that you do all at once and then forget about for three years. It’s an iterative process that starts with clarifying and communicating one thing at a time to get you closer and closer to the personal brand that truly reflects who you are.  That means that no, you don’t have to figure everything out right now, but if you’re going to start anywhere, start by answering these three questions:  What do you do? Who do you do it for? What value do you add? Answering these three questions and putting them into a sentence you can pop in your social media bio, on your website, in your email footer, and talk about in your content, will do wonders for your brand.  For example:  Hollie Arnett is a brand coach and strategist helping creatives like you get more eyes on your work, more dollars in your pocket, and more creativity in your life. Meg Lewis is a designer, comedian, performer, and educator working to make the world a happier place.

But it can be hard to know where to start or what to focus on. ** **In this article we’ll cover three main areas of your business that will help you with each stage, whether you are just starting out, beginning to grow, or ready to scale. ** Part 1: Starting your freelance graphic design business As you take the leap and venture into freelancing for the first time, there are some foundational things that you need to learn before you can get started. Your focus should be on finding your first clients, getting paid, and doing a great job on their projects.  Finding Your First Clients  Tip 1: Utilise your existing network  Finding your first client can be easier than you think. You likely have an existing network of friends, family members, colleagues, classmates, or online connections who you can reach out to about working together. Even if they don’t need work, they might know someone who does.  Reach out to them personally, or put out a request on social media for any referrals. You can also do some volunteer work for a charity or other organisation to get your first clients, gain some experience, have some testimonials to share to get your first paying clients, and do some good in the process.  Tip 2: Build your portfolio  Another great way to find your first clients is by building your portfolio. In the beginning, this could include volunteer work, school projects, and/or self-initiated work. You don’t need to have 50 projects to start getting clients - 3–5 high-quality projects is a great place to start and would be enough to get that first client.  Building a portfolio is valuable for two reasons:  It gives you more work and testimonials to put on your website or show to prospective clients, and It grows your network, giving you access to more prospective clients. Tip 3: Share your work  Once you’ve got some volunteer work, school projects, or self-initiated designs together, don’t forget to share them with your network!

Tip 3: Share your work  Once you’ve got some volunteer work, school projects, or self-initiated designs together, don’t forget to share them with your network! Send it to your personal connections and share it on social media to start getting your name out there, making more connections, and building a reputation for the kind of work you do.  Onboarding Your Clients  Send Proposals  Once you’ve found a client who is interested in working with you, it’s time to quote them for the project and send a proposal for the work. Your proposal should include an overview of the project, the price, payment terms, a detailed description of what’s included in the project, and a list of the deliverables. If you’re quoting a client for the first time, you could also include a section about you and why you’re a great fit for them, with some testimonials to back you up.  Sign Contracts  One of the most important things for a freelancer is to always have your client sign a contract. This protects both you and the client, and makes all aspects of the project clear to both parties. It is rare that you will need to enforce a clause from your contract, but on those rare occasions that you do, having a signed contract will protect everyone involved. Contracts can include things like:  The project price Payment terms Late fees for unpaid invoices How expenses are treated The project timeline Who owns the work Confidentiality Whether you can include the work in your portfolio What happens if someone wants to cancel the project Welcome Clients  When all of the practical aspects of your project are accepted and signed, you can welcome your client! Celebrate this moment and make it exciting for them. They’ve just invested their money in your work and it could be the start of an amazing partnership. You could email them a welcome document that outlines the process, record a welcome video to say how excited you are to work with them, send them a gift to welcome them as a client, or any number of other things to mark this occasion!  Getting paid  Price your services  One of the most difficult things about freelancing is knowing how to price your work. You need to decide what pricing strategy you will use and how much you will charge. 48% of freelancers get paid on a fixed fee, while 29% are paid hourly, and 23% experience a mix of both, but there are many","metadata":{"id":42}}],["43",{"pageContent":" to decide what pricing strategy you will use and how much you will charge. 48% of freelancers get paid on a fixed fee, while 29% are paid hourly, and 23% experience a mix of both, but there are many options for pricing your work:  Hourly (X amount of dollars per hours worked) Fixed (a fixed $ amount for the whole project) Retainer (an ongoing arrangement where you are paid the same amount per period of time) Set up your payments  Deciding how much you charge is one thing, but getting paid is another! Setting up an easy invoicing system will make sure you can accept different types of payments from different clients and make it easy for them to pay you. Doing this now will have you invoicing like a pro from the beginning. Your invoices should include:  Your name and contact details The client’s name and contact details Your tax information The price The payment deadline (Most freelancers give clients 2 to 4 weeks to pay an invoice once it’s sent) Any taxes that are included Available payment methods The words “Tax Invoice” if you’re GST registered Manage your money  The ability to save money as a freelancer is the biggest worry for an astonishing 76% of freelancers, followed by saving for retirement and having an unpredictable income. Also concerning is 6 out of 10 freelancers feel like they live paycheck to paycheck. But being financially savvy isn’t something all freelancers think about when they get started. However, if you set up a system and learn to manage your money now with a budget, savings, and your taxes covered, you’ll be much more prepared to weather any financial challenges that freelancers can face.

At this stage, it’s all about elevating your client experiences, growing your client base and reaching new people, and investing back in your business to grow.  Keep Your Clients Coming Back  Curate the experience  It’s five times more expensive to attract new clients than it is to keep existing ones.

Celebrate the launch of their new designs, send them a gift at the end of your project, share their successes on social media, or think of other ways that you can continue to champion your clients even after your project is finished. They’re part of your success story and on your team, so treat them with gratitude and celebration.  Check in on your clients  41% of freelancers find work from their previous clients, so it’s also important to check in on clients regularly once your project is finished. 1 month, 6 months, and a year after you finish working with them, (if they haven’t been back to work with you already,) get in touch. Ask them how things are going, if they need any help with or have any questions about the deliverables you gave them, and if there’s anything else you can do to support them. Keeping in touch, being available, and supporting them on an ongoing basis is a great way to continue building client loyalty as a freelancer.  Finding More Clients  Market your business  Your initial clients will likely come through friends, family, and people in your existing network. But to grow your business and get in front of more clients, you need to start actively marketing your business and building an effective sales pipeline that brings you potential clients regularly. This could include strategies like:  Social media content Email marketing Blogging Podcasting YouTube videos Twitch streaming Paid ads Speaking Printed marketing material Grow your network  Since consumers referred by a friend are four times more likely to buy, another great strategy is to grow your freelance business through networking. The more people know who you are and what you do, the more likely you are to be recommended for work or for collaboration and marketing opportunities. So focus on genuinely engaging with people in the design industry, as well as people in the industry you want to be working with, and creating a community of people who know and support you.

Encourage referrals  Over 33% of freelancers get their jobs through referrals, so encouraging and requesting referrals could be one of the best ways to find your next contract. When you finish a project with a client, make sure to ask them for feedback, a testimonial, and any referrals they might have for other people who may value your services. You can also offer a referral program where they earn credits or other rewards with you for referring you to others.  Investing in your business  Get a mentor  One of the best ways to get to the next level in your business is to learn from someone who is already there or has been there. A mentor will help get the best out of you, guide you to where you want to go, support you along the way, and push you to grow. Find a mentor or coach whose approach and values align with yours, and if they don’t already offer mentoring, see if they would be interested in mentoring you.  **Level up your skills **  Your freelance business isn’t going to grow if you aren’t. It’s important to regularly uplevel your skills in things like networking, marketing, financial management, project management, or skills to transition to a new field or niche. Depending on what aspect of your business you’d like to grow and develop, make sure to actively uplevel your skills in that area through books, videos, podcasts, courses, downloads, and other available resources.  Upgrade your tools  When you started your freelance business, you likely got started with what you had on hand and kept things quite lean at first. But as you grow, it might be time to upgrade your tools to make things easier, faster, and better. That could include better computer gear, design software, project management tools, and other things that you use throughout your business. Investing can be scary, but consider the return on investment, weigh it up in your budget, and decide whether it’s worth the investment to upgrade that tool.  Part 3: Scaling your freelance graphic design business In the later stages of your freelance business, once you’ve been underway for a few years, it will be time for you to scale your operations.

This includes booking bigger and better clients, becoming a leader in your field, and starting to think about growing your team!  Booking Bigger Clients  Niche your business  Once you have built and grown your business, it could be time to niche down. It might seem counterintuitive to niche smaller when you want to scale bigger, but niching makes scaling more achievable. By niching down, you become an expert in that area which makes it easier to design for those people as you already know all the ins and outs of their industry. It also makes you an expert in the eyes of your audience, which means you are more likely to be recommended as the go-to designer for that niche, as past clients know and refer you for being so knowledgeable.  You can niche in a number of different ways, too. It doesn’t just have to be the clients you work for. Your niche could be:  The industry you work for (ie. designer for wellness brands) The price-bracket or business stage you work with (ie. designer for early-stage startups) The skill you offer (ie. Webflow designer) The style you work in (ie. 3D illustrator) Become an expert  If you’re looking to scale to bigger and better clients, they’re going to be looking for someone who knows their stuff. At those higher prices, they’re not looking for someone who can just execute the design, they’re looking for an expert who can offer expertise, consult on decisions, and guide the process with confidence. Creating content and showing up online in a way that establishes credibility and shows that you’re an expert is going to help land those bigger clients. So think about how you can establish yourself as an expert in your field and impress those dream clients.  Use social proof  If most of your clients up until this point have been friends, family, or referrals from those people, they already know and trust you to do great work. But when you’re marketing yourself to others who are just hearing about you for the first time, they need to know that they can trust you. That’s where social proof comes in. Share testimonials from past clients, results from previous projects, screenshots of positive feedback, and reshare when a client mentions you online.  Automating Your Processes  **Create easy onboarding **  One of the best ways to scale your freelance design","metadata":{"id":46}}],["47",{"pageContent":". Share testimonials from past clients, results from previous projects, screenshots of positive feedback, and reshare when a client mentions you online.  Automating Your Processes  **Create easy onboarding **  One of the best ways to scale your freelance design business is by automating parts of your process so that you can get back to what you do best: designing! Creating an automated, repeatable system for your onboarding process will make it faster, easier, and more hands-off for you to book and welcome clients. You can use software like Hnry forkeeping track of your clients and invoices, as well as automation apps like Zapier to connect different tools together, such as contact tools. So for example, you could have an automation that sends a welcome email to your client once their contract has been signed.  Streamline the design process  70% of freelancers manage two to four projects at once, so once you’ve onboarded clients, you want to streamline the actual design process too in order to make sure that you can easily manage all of your projects. You can use automation tools and purpose-built software to make the design and feedback process as streamlined and efficient as possible for both you and your clients.  For example, with software like Figma, you can collaborate and communicate with your clients in the same software you design in, or you can use Adobe Creative Cloud to share Adobe documents with clients for them to comment on which you can see directly in your working file. Tools like this will help you scale your processes and ultimately, your business.  Finish projects in style  The way that you onboard clients is important, but so is how you offboard them. When you’ve finished a project, find ways to make the process of delivering their assets and wrapping things up as easy and amazing as possible. What software could you use to seamlessly deliver assets? Could you send them guides or videos on how to implement their new assets? Maybe you could send them a gift or thank you note, or take them out for lunch to celebrate the project. First impressions matter, but last impressions are what people remember, so make it count!  Growing Your Team  Outsource work  At some point as you grow and scale your business, you’re going to reach a point where you can’t do it all on your own.

For example, as a web designer, you could collaborate with illustrators, copywriters or developers. Together you can collaborate on a holistic process and split the payment between you.  Hire your team  And last but not least, you could be ready to hire your own team. This could mean other designers, but could also include project managers, accountants, developers, and other roles that would support your business. Think about which roles you need first and will help you scale the most successfully.  Whether you are starting, growing, or scaling your freelance design business, these tips will help you with where you’re at, and with getting to the next stage. Own where you are, take care with each step, and keep working towards the next stage! The holy grail for any freelancer is a steady trickle of new clients and projects coming in. This gives you three great advantages:  You can start being a bit more picky about what you take on, and what you pass on. No more boring projects! You can start booking your time weeks or months out - giving you a lot more confidence that you’ll be busy. You can start charging more. But to get there, you need to do a bit of self-marketing. You need to have a large, consistently growing “pool” of people who know what you do and why they should work with you. The larger this pool is, the more frequently you’ll have someone reach out to you and ask if they can work with you specifically.  Over the past year or so, I’ve found Linkedin to be a free, easy way to build this pool of people.    Why Linkedin? Linkedin has a huge advantage over the other social media platforms: it’s easy to get your content in front of people.  If you’ve ever dabbled in posting on Facebook, you’ll know that it’s incredibly difficult to get people to see the content you post - even the people who follow you!

One estimate is that only 10% of your Facebook followers see your posts.And that’s the people who have told Facebook they want to see your posts!  If you want more than 10% of your followers to see your content on Facebook, you need to open your wallet and pay for ads, This gets really expensive, really quickly.  Linkedin doesn’t work like this. When you post on Linkedin, the algorithm will serve it up to people who follow you. If any of those people like or comment on it, it will then go into their feeds as well. If those people like or comment on it, it goes further still - and so on, and so forth.  This means that you can get your content in front of lots of people for free - as long as the content’s good enough to get people engaged in it (more on that in a second). But that’s a lot more affordable than paying to force it in front of people.  What’s more, people on Linkedin are “primed” to read work-related content in a way that people on other social networks are not. I routinely post copywriting tips on Linkedin. By and large, these do quite well. I don’t think they would do as well on another platform, like Instagram, because people scrolling Instagram aren’t necessarily looking for copywriting tips.  So Linkedin gives you easy access to a receptive audience. Now here’s how to get your content in front of them:    Step 1: Post useful content You’re an expert in something. That’s why people pay you to do freelance work - you have skills and knowledge that they don’t have. Otherwise, they wouldn’t hire you.  So post content based on that expertise!  This can look a little daunting before you get into the swing of things, so here’s a few tips to get some ideas flowing:  Have a look at Quora - search for your field, and see what questions people are asking about it. Then just answer those questions in the form of a Linkedin post. Read (or re-read) a book or article about your field. Write a post about the most interesting ideas, and your view on those ideas. Address common myths or misconceptions about your field. Talk about how you approach your work A lot of what you post is going to feel very obvious.","metadata":{"id":49}}],["50",{"pageContent":" about your field. Write a post about the most interesting ideas, and your view on those ideas. Address common myths or misconceptions about your field. Talk about how you approach your work A lot of what you post is going to feel very obvious. That’s because you’re an expert. But remember, the people reading aren’t experts. And if they read something useful from you, they’re not only getting value from your post - they’re also being reminded that you have deep knowledge in your field.  The key is to not think about it too much. Just write something useful and interesting, press post, and move on. It’s not really about any one post. Rather, it’s about getting into the habit of posting on a regular basis.  Which brings me to the next point:   Step 2: Post regularly Posting once every week or two isn’t going to cut it. You’re going to need to be posting at least a few times a week - preferably every day. And you’ll need to be consistent. Don’t just flame out after two weeks. You need to post a few times a week, week in, week out.  Remember what I said above about Linkedin not curating peoples’ feeds as much as the likes of Facebook and Instagram? There’s a downside to that - everyone is out there posting heaps. And people are posting good content!  So if you’re just posting every now and again, while other people are posting daily, you’re just going to get drowned out - even if your content is just as good, or better. That means you need to post a decent amount, and you need to keep at it.   Step 3: Grow your network Once you start posting on a regular basis, people are going to start adding you as a connection. Accept them! If you don’t like their content, you can just hide it from your feed, but they’ll still see yours. And if they like what they see, they’ll engage, which will in turn amplify your content.  At the same time, don’t be afraid to add people as connections. I generally add people when they like or comment on my content. For some reason, that’s less weird on Linkedin than it would be on a platform like Facebook.  But you can do what you’re comfortable with. Just remember that the larger your network is, the more opportunities you have to get your content in front of people and show how talented you are","metadata":{"id":50}}],["51",{"pageContent":" Linkedin than it would be on a platform like Facebook.

Give it a go If you take one thing from this article, it should be this: login to Linkedin and give this approach a go. The more you overthink any individual post, the more likely you are to talk yourself out of it.  Remember, this is a long term thing. No one post is going to make or break your career as a freelancer. Rather, you’ll build your reputation and authority over time as you consistently post useful content that showcases your expertise.  It’s not going to happen overnight! But at the same time, posting on Linkedin doesn’t take much time and it doesn’t cost any money. So try this tactic for a few months. I think you’ll like your results. Contracting is an amazing way of life. When you go out contracting, numerous benefits open up: A better work/life balance: as your own boss, you can often determine where and when you work. The potential to earn more money: as a contractor, you’ll get paid on an hourly rate, which is set at market rates. If your skillset is in demand, you could earn more money than if you were permanently employed. The ability to test out different industries and workplaces on an impermanent basis can help you pivot into areas you hadn’t previously thought of exploring. Contracting is becoming increasingly sought after by companies all over the world. Embracing the ‘flexible’ workforce is key for these organisations to attract the best talent possible, with the least amount of risk. But there’s a lot that people don’t tell you about how to thrive as a contractor, and there are a lot of myths floating around out there. So to help, we prepared this guide that will help you navigate through the different aspects of contracting. If you’re new to the world of contracting, this guide will steer you in a direction that will hopefully get you more prepared for finding work and knowing what your obligations are. If you’re a seasoned contractor, this guide will provide some tools and insights that might have been previously missing from your toolbox.

Here’s what we’re going to cover:  Common Myths about Being a Contractor What’s the Difference Between a Contractor and an Employee? The Admin Stuff: What You Need to Know How to Find Work as a Contractor How to Take the Hassle Out of Contracting In spite of all the awesome opportunities of contract work, it does come with many financial obligations that would normally be taken care of by a permanent employer.  For instance, Income tax, GST, ACC, KiwiSaver all get dropped on your plate when you become a contractor. And if you’ve been working in permanent employment your whole career, it can be very difficult to actually know where to begin. Planning for your future can be difficult, as you could be earning an income on an irregular basis.  Not only that, but there’s a lot of misinformation (what you need to do to get set up, for example) out there. For instance, it’s a common misconception that you need to be registered as a business in order to go out contracting. This is absolutely not true, and for those who were given this advice, it’s very likely that you’re doing twice as much tax paperwork as is needed (one return filing for you, the individual; one filing for your registered business).  This is just one of those common myths about contracting, and there are many others. So let’s kick things off by debunking some common myths and misconceptions that surround contract work.   Common Myths about Being a Contractor Myth 1: You need to register as a business in order to be a contractor  Despite what you might have heard from various sources (accountants, NZBN, Xero, and many others), this is not at all true. In the vast majority of cases, you absolutely don’t need to register as a business in order to work as a contractor. As a sole trader, you can still claim expenses, register for GST and use a logo and trading name - there are little or no tax advantages to registering as a business, and you should really only consider it if you intend to actually run a small business - i.e. take on permanent staff, and have stock, inventory and creditors.  If you’re thinking of registering a company, you may want to check if this is the right approach for you. When you register as a business, you’ll not only need to make regular","metadata":{"id":52}}],["53",{"pageContent":" permanent staff, and have stock, inventory and creditors.  If you’re thinking of registering a company, you may want to check if this is the right approach for you. When you register as a business, you’ll not only need to make regular submissions to the Companies Office to keep your business name, you’ll also have to send them annual reports and other documentation. You’ll also need to file additional tax returns - as not only will you need to file your personal tax returns, you’ll also have to file Companies Income Tax (IR4) and company GST returns where applicable. Getting through all this paperwork may incur additional costs, and will probably involve you spending a lot of time wading through regulations that could have been avoided.  Myth 2: Working as a contractor means you won’t be able to grow your career/skills  Contracting gives you more flexibility in your day-to-day life, but it also presents plenty of opportunities to be exposed to different types of organisations, project managers, technologies, and styles of working – all of which will help you acquire new skills on and in-between a job. If you work multiple contracts concurrently (say, as a designer, with multiple different clients), you’re able to gain multi-dimensional experience that you wouldn’t get through permanent employment. You’ll also be able to meet people through your contracted work that might lead you to more contract opportunities as you progress through your career.  Moreover, you might have a couple of weeks available between contracts to work on developing new skills – either through online or in-person courses, hands-on workshops, training seminars, or some other means. At these training events, you might even be able to meet people in your industry and expand your network even further.  Developing new skills in this way will give you the opportunity to grow as a contractor and come across new jobs that you would otherwise not have had access to.  Myth 3: Being a contractor is less stable than being a permanent employee  There shouldn’t be much instability in work if you’ve got all the right things in place: ie, if you have a good (or developing) network of potential clients, if you maintain a wide range of relevant skills, if your CV is up-to-date, and if you ensure that you’re looking for new contracts about a month before your current contract is set to expire. There is a huge rise in contract work these days, across both government and private sector, and this can work in your favour.","metadata":{"id":53}}],["54",{"pageContent":", and if you ensure that you’re looking for new contracts about a month before your current contract is set to expire. There is a huge rise in contract work these days, across both government and private sector, and this can work in your favour. If you’re competent, professional and have a good set of skills, there’s no shortage of work. Conversely, when you’re in permanent work, you’re only one ‘re-shuffle’ away from being made redundant - so there’s never been a better time to go contracting.  The switch from permanent to contract can be difficult to navigate if you don’t get the right support (there is a lot of admin to keep track of, all of which is now no longer automatically handled for you by an employer). But contracting can ultimately be very rewarding. You have more flexibility in working, more opportunities to learn new skills, and, with the ability to work multiple contracts at once, more options to grow out your portfolio of experience.  So we’ve debunked some of the most common myths that surround contract work. But there’s still a lot of unnecessarily enigmatic information out there, primarily in regards to the differences between a contractor and a permanent employee.   What is the Difference Between a Contractor and an Employee? Permanent Employees:  are paid a regular set salary or wage have Income Tax paid on their earnings automatically by their employer Have ACC levies taken paid on their earnings automatically by their employer. Have Student Loan deductions paid on their earnings automatically by their employer Can make automatic KiwiSaver contributions on their earnings, matched by their employer Are entitled to holiday leave and sick days, Independent Contractors:  are paid on an hourly or daily rate, often working on contracts of between 1 and 6 months. are classified as ‘self-employed’ and as such must pay their own Income Tax, ACC levies and file GST returns (if applicable). don’t get annual leave or sick days If you’re going contracting, you’ll need to be aware of the following:   The Admin Stuff Income Tax  Unlike a situation in which you’re employed on a salary/PAYE basis, when you’re contracting it’s your responsibility to calculate and pay the right amount of tax to IRD. Every year in April, you’ll need to file an annual Income Tax return (IR3) declaring all income and expenditure to IRD for the preceding year.  Withholding Tax  If you work through a Recruiter or other similar ‘lab","metadata":{"id":54}}],["55",{"pageContent":". Every year in April, you’ll need to file an annual Income Tax return (IR3) declaring all income and expenditure to IRD for the preceding year.  Withholding Tax  If you work through a Recruiter or other similar ‘labour-hire’, they may ask you to fill in an IR330C form, to specify a rate of Withholding Tax for them to deduct from your pay every time they pay you. This rate of tax is fixed for your entire period of employment with them, and it is worth noting that more often than not, it will be an incorrect estimation of your tax rate. An individual’s tax rate is very rarely a round number, and quite often, nominating an arbitrary rate on an IR330C form can leave you paying either too much, or too little tax on your earnings. Your employer or recruiter is not responsible for making sure that the tax rate you elect to provide to them is accurate, and so it is your responsibility to choose the right tax rate to provide.  Provisional Tax  When you submit an IR3 income tax return to Inland Revenue at the end of the Financial Year, if you owe more than $2,500 in income tax, you will be required to be subject to Provisional Tax payments in the following financial year. As part of the IR3 return, you will be asked to predict your income for the forthcoming year. Be aware - getting these predictions wrong, or deliberately fiddling your Provisional Tax predictions can result in fines and penalties. Being subject to Provisional Tax means that you will need to estimate your future income, and make 3 payments throughout the financial year, on a set schedule, to ensure that you’re paying your taxes in advance. Check out our guide to understanding provisional tax here.  Terminal Tax  If you are making Provisional Tax payments throughout the year, and these payments do not fully cover the tax owing on your income (for instance if you earn more than the income you predicted on your IR3 return), then you will be subject to Terminal Tax, which is the balance of tax owing. You must pay any Terminal Tax payments on or before the IRD due date.  ACC Levies  Whenever you file an IR3 tax return, IRD will inform ACC of your previous year’s earnings, and ACC will calculate how much you owe for your ACC cover and will send you a bill. Be aware that ACC bills may come out of the blue, without","metadata":{"id":55}}],["56",{"pageContent":" an IR3 tax return, IRD will inform ACC of your previous year’s earnings, and ACC will calculate how much you owe for your ACC cover and will send you a bill. Be aware that ACC bills may come out of the blue, without any warning, and they’ll likely be for a sizeable amount. In order to not get caught out over - or underpaying, you’ll need to ensure ACC has all the right information, and that they have you on the correct levy rate for the type of work you do. The default ACC work type is Manufacturing - which carries a very high levy rate, so it definitely pays to make sure that ACC has all the right information for you. Once you’ve got all of the right information to ACC, you’ll need to calculate and pay the three types of ACC levies (N.B. most accountants will not do this for you):  Earners’ Levy Work Levy Working Safer Levy For more about ACC and understanding your ACC invoice check out our handy guide.  GST (Goods & Services Tax)  If you earn over $60,000/year as a contractor, you‘ll need to register for GST. Once registered, you’ll have to file regular GST returns on a 1, 2 or 6-monthly basis and make GST payments to IRD for any GST that is owing. Registering for GST means that you’ll need to charge your clients 15% extra for your services, and will be required to pass this additional income directly on to IRD. If you incur eligible business expenses, you are able to claim back the GST portion of those expenses and offset that against the GST you owe IRD from your income. If claiming business expenses, you’ll also need to keep receipts as records for 7 years. See more about what GST is and how it works here.  N.B. GST is something that is charged in addition to your income - it does not replace Income Tax or remove the need for you to pay Income Tax on your earnings.  Professional Insurance  Your contract may require you to have Professional Insurance (you may be able to have this provided by your recruiter). Otherwise, you’ll need to arrange this yourself and provide your recruiter/client with a valid insurance certificate. Professional Insurance usually covers two aspects - Public Liability Insurance and Professional Indemnity Insurance. Public Liability insurance will cover you for any detrimental impact your work has on members of the public - such as causing accidents or","metadata":{"id":56}}],["57",{"pageContent":" recruiter/client with a valid insurance certificate.

Public Liability insurance will cover you for any detrimental impact your work has on members of the public - such as causing accidents or harm, whilst Professional Indemnity Insurance covers you for any negative impact your work might have on a client organisation you work for  Student Loan  If you’re a contractor, you’ll need to make sure you calculate and set aside enough money every time you get paid to cover Student Loan repayments, as IRD will expect this to be paid regularly on your income. Unlike when you have a permanent/salary job where your employer makes student loan deductions, you will be solely responsible for managing all student loan deductions from your contracting income.  Business Expenses  If you incur business expenses as part of your contracting work, you may be eligible for tax relief on those expenses. For example, if you purchase equipment in order to be able to perform your work, you will be able to lodge these as business expenses to reduce the amount of your income that you need to pay tax on. If you are GST registered, you may also be able to claim the value of the GST portion of the expense, and offset that against any GST collected from your clients.  Home Office Expenses  If you work from home as a contractor, you may be able to claim home office expenses to get a reduction in your income tax liability. You’ll need to calculate the claimable proportion of your utility bills in comparison to the size of your home office and make sure you hold on to all receipts. You can claim all sorts of things as home office expenses, ranging everywhere from utility expenses (power and Internet) to office supplies. It can be a challenge to figure out what can and cannot be claimed as a home office expense, and the portion of that which is claimable largely depends on how you measure out your home office. There are some pretty helpful resources out there, as well as our guide to household expenses, for determining how to apportion your home office area, all of which can provide some further assistance and insights.  Timesheets  When working as a contractor, you will be expected to log and track the hours you work for a particular client you work for. Your clients will not pay you for the hours where you are not present in their office or on site, and that includes lunch breaks, doctor’s appointments, or childcare commitments.

Depending on your needs and your unique lifestyle, it might make more sense to use one kind of timesheet tool versus another.  Invoices  Rather than automatically receiving a Payslip from your employer every time you get paid, when you are a contractor you may need to raise an Invoice to your client in order to have them pay you. Invoices must have a set format, and usually, you will need to wait a period of time after issuing the invoice for your client to pay - most clients tend to wait up to 20 days before paying an invoice! Some recruiters or other 3rd parties will raise what is known as a ‘buyer-created invoice’ - where they will create the invoice on your behalf, pay you directly and provide you with a ‘remittance’ specifying the earnings they have paid you. Buyer Created Invoices (BCI) are usually based on a Timesheet that you have provided. It is worth noting that you will need to hold on to all Remittance advices you are sent by your clients for 7 years, to maintain accurate records. Here’s our ultimate guide to invoicing like a pro.  Putting Money Away  When you’re a contractor, you won’t get paid holidays or sick days. This means that in times when you’re not working, you’ll need to have some money put away to cover your household and personal expenses. It is recommended that you put away enough funds to cover at least 2 months worth of your household expenditure. Here’s a quick article to guide you through planning for those dream holidays and unexpected sick days.  Work out how much you should charge  We’ve put together this handy calculator to guide you on how much you should charger for your services.      How to Find Work as a Contractor Whether you’ve recently started looking for contract work, or have been a contractor for years, here are a few tips that might help the process of finding new contracts a bit more manageable:  Make use of your network.

Know what you want. Reach out to anyone you know (people you’ve worked with, friends and family, any contacts you may have in your personal directory) and inquire about any jobs that might be going. Chances are, if they know you, your skills and your experience, they might be able to connect you with people in their networks – and from there, things can start to really snowball.  There are a few things to keep in mind when finding contract work through your existing network, however – primarily in how to interact with potential clients. When approaching someone for a potential work opportunity, either through a casual coffee meeting or on a more formal cold call, be very clear about what you want to get from them. A potential client’s time is incredibly valuable. The more you take note of and appreciate them taking the time to meet with you, the more you stand out as a potential contractor.  Get connected to some recruitment agencies. Recruitment agents are incredibly connected to companies and organisations that are actively looking for work. The sheer number of job openings and available candidates means going through a recruitment is most likely the most direct way of finding contract work, if your network leads turn up dry.  Find someone at a recruitment agency (it could even be as general as uploading an up-to-date CV to a known recruitment agency). Look for any opportunity to display your interest in a particular job.  How do you determine which recruitment agency to use? There are multiple types of recruitment agencies out there, ranging from IT recruitment to engineering recruitment, to hospitality. Understanding the type of work you’re looking for (or have come from) is a great first step. Are you looking for a long term placement? Or more of a short term contract? What type of contract work, industry, and organisations are you looking to be involved with? Check out the different types of recruitment agencies below. Some of these are massive, international agencies that don’t really have one area of expertise; others are more specific, such as The Creative Store and Beca; while some are more geared towards really empowering contractors, such as Potentia and Find.

LinkedIn: LinkedIn is a rapidly growing resource for recruitment and can connect you with the people at companies that interest you. And who knows? You might actually know someone who works at a company you’ve always thought about working for, or in a field of work that you hadn’t previously given much thought to. Ensuring you have an up-to-date profile on LinkedIn is essential to finding jobs that fit your set of skills and experience.

Taking the Hassle Out of Contracting If you’d rather not worry about the admin, even if you need help finding work, Hnry can provide you with the tools, support, and network that will let you really hit the ground running as a contractor.  Founded by contractors, the Hnry service not only handles tax calculations, payments and filings each time you get paid, but can also set you up with a wide-reaching network of recruitment agencies that can help you find contract work, and financial advisors that can help you plan for your future.  Hnry’s team of tax experts will review your business and client chargeable expenses in real time, providing you with instant tax relief on your expenses – all for no extra cost.  As a registered tax agent with both IRD and ACC, we’ll represent you to these government agencies and ensure that you’re compliant and up-to-date on all of your obligations.  Before Hnry, recruiters were erroneously tasked with deducting Withholding Tax. This led to risky tax advice, recruiters essentially operating as non-certified tax agents. Hnry takes care of this aspect of contracting and ensures that contractors have their Withholding Tax deducted by a certified tax agent.   Complete Contractor Support at an Affordable Price Hnry costs just 1% of your contracting income and with its ‘pay-as-you-go’ model, you’ll only have to pay for the service until you get paid yourself (in which case you will become linked to the Hnry tax agency). For that 1% fee, the Hnry service will provide you with the following:  Income Tax and GST calculations, filings and payments ACC and Student Loan calculations and payments Smart invoicing software Electronic expense management, reviewed by a team of tax experts The ability to create automatic payments to a savings account, investment wallet, or utility company – each time you get paid.

As a freelancer, how you price your work has a huge impact on your career. Charge too much, and you may not get enough work to stay busy. Charge too little, and it’s easy to end up working all the time for very little payoff. Then there’s the detail of how you charge. Do you want the predictability of hourly rates? Or are you willing to take the risk of fixed prices and package deals, in order to potentially earn higher hourly rates? All these approaches have different pros and cons that are important to work through before making a decision.  This guide attacks pricing from a number of angles. First, we’ll help you to find your minimum rates - the lowest rate you’ll accept in order to keep the lights on and compensate you for the risk of running a business.  Then we’ll work through three pricing models: hourly rates, fixed rates, and packaged deals.  Then at the end, we’ll talk about setting your price based on value, and how you can estimate the value you’re adding. Finally, we’ll talk about the thing that every freelancer wants to do but few manage to do: raising your rates (without losing too many clients).  At the end, we’ve included links to a few external sources that you can use to go into more detail on pricing. We’ve included quotes from these sources throughout the guide.  Enjoy!   1: Setting your minimums The very first thing you need to know about pricing is your minimum. This is the lowest amount you can charge per hour, per project, per week, or however you want to structure your business, in order to pay your bills and earn the kind of money you want to earn.  This sets a floor for your pricing conversations in the future. It’s important to have a clear idea of this figure, because it “anchors” your price negotiations. If a potential client’s budget is below this figure, you can instantly decline, rather than work through a complicated negotiation only to find yourself earning less than you need to live on.  To start, you’ll need to know the answer to this question:   How much money do you want to make? You need to figure out how much money you want to make per year. This number is entirely up to you, but a good place to start is to try and figure out how much you would make doing the","metadata":{"id":62}}],["63",{"pageContent":" much money do you want to make? You need to figure out how much money you want to make per year. This number is entirely up to you, but a good place to start is to try and figure out how much you would make doing the same work as an employee. Then, add a hefty percentage on top of that. This is to compensate for:  The risk you’re taking by not agreeing to work with the same person every day. The costs you incur that you wouldn’t incur as an employee (a laptop, a desk, any equipment) Your profit! (Remember, you’re a business - you’re just both the owner and the one employee of that business) Of course, you might value the flexibility of self-employment enough that you’re willing to make as much or less than you would as an employee. That is okay too! You can structure this however you want, but it’s important to work through the tradeoffs because this is what will inform your pricing decisions further down the track.   Divide your figure Once you’ve arrived at an annual figure, start dividing it down into chunks. Your goal here is to find a monthly, weekly and daily rate. Remember to account for things like annual leave, public holidays, and seasonal fluctuations in your workload. For example, if you provide services to lots of corporations and government organisations, your summer will probably be reasonably slow - especially around Christmas. If you’re a wedding photographer, your summers will probably be very busy!  So allow for this, and come up with how much you need to make for each month of the year. Depending on the types of contracts you get, or the type of work you do, you may want to take this to an even more granular level - even down to the day!  But no matter how far down you choose to go, you now have something to work with.   An example Let’s say you want to make $60,000 a year. That is an even $5,000 per month. Assuming no public holidays, you have around 20 working days per month. This means that if you don’t want to work weekends, you need to make $250 per day.  Of course, this might be an average figure. You might make nothing on Monday, then $500 on Tuesday. But you now know that, more or less, you need to have $250 of work committed to every day.  Now you have something to work with.","metadata":{"id":63}}],["64",{"pageContent":" be an average figure. You might make nothing on Monday, then $500 on Tuesday. But you now know that, more or less, you need to have $250 of work committed to every day.  Now you have something to work with.   Look at the time available One of the stark realities of freelancing is that you aren’t going to be productive 100% of the time. You might be working 40 hours (or more) per week, but not all of those hours are going to be spent working for clients on projects you can charge for. You’ll need to do admin like invoicing and expenses, you’ll need to do business development, you’ll need to prepare quotes for potential clients. All of this stuff takes time.    Be generous when you estimate how long all the non-billable work will take. This gives you more “headroom” in your time spent on client work - if you estimate you’ll spend half your time on non-client work and half your time on client work, but end up spending ¾ of your time on client work, you’ll end up making more than you’d budgeted for. That is much better than the alternative of underestimating how much time you’ll spend on non-client work.   Now you have a number Now you have a number. Well, two numbers actually. One is how much you want to make per week. The other is how much time you have each week to make that money.  The next step is to find your target hourly rate:    This is your starting point for pricing. If you go with an hourly model, you now know how much to charge per hour. If you’re going to go with a packages model, then you know what to price your packages at - and how many you’ll need to do per week. And if you go with a fixed price model, you now know how to price a week’s worth of work.  Here’s a really important point about that number, though: it is a floor not a ceiling. The number you have arrived at sets a bare minimum you can charge; it is not a maximum. In fact, you shouldn’t be afraid to charge more than this figure. We’ll get into that in a lot more detail later on.   2: Charging by the hour Charging by the hour is the first pricing model we’ll look at.

It’s great for:  Open-ended engagements Those who are new to freelancing Those who don’t want the risk of charging a fixed fee But it also has a few drawbacks. In this chapter, we’ll outline some reasons to use hourly pricing - and when to avoid it.   Why charge hourly rates? The big drawcard of hourly rates is predictability of income - you always know how much your time is worth and how much you’ll earn given a certain amount of work. If you work 20 hours and charge (for example) $50 per hour, you’ll make $1,000. When you know exactly how long you’re going to work, an hourly rate gives you clear expectations for how much income you will earn.  This makes it much easier to regularly hit your daily or weekly income targets. All you need to do is divide your weekly target by the number of hours you want to charge out, then fill those hours with client work. If you can find enough work to fill the hours, then you’ll hit your targets.  Another benefit of hourly rates is that you can just get to work immediately. If you’re charging fixed prices, there’s a lot of admin work up front. You need to negotiate with clients to determine how much you’re going to do; for what price; what’s in scope; and what’s out of scope. This can be time-consuming, and generally isn’t worth it for smaller projects.  Hourly rates are great for engagements that don’t have a clear scope. If you’re in a “you don’t know what you don’t know” situation, where you need to help a client solve a problem, but you don’t really know how big that problem is or how long it’s going to take to solve, then it can make a lot of sense to charge an hourly rate. Otherwise, it’s hard to accurately estimate a price for the project. What’s more, it’s basically impossible to put together a clear scope for these projects, because you don’t know what they’re going to look like.  This is one reason why lawyers often use hourly rates - it’s extremely hard (if not impossible) to guess ahead of time how much effort a case or other legal project is going to take. Charging by the hour means lawyers don","metadata":{"id":65}}],["66",{"pageContent":" look like.  This is one reason why lawyers often use hourly rates - it’s extremely hard (if not impossible) to guess ahead of time how much effort a case or other legal project is going to take. Charging by the hour means lawyers don’t have to sit and try to figure this out; they can just get to work.   Why avoid hourly rates? But hourly rates aren’t perfect. The main drawback of hourly rates is that they do not reward efficiency.  Let’s say you’re a graphic designer. You have a client who you’ve been working with for a few years. Every month, you design a landing page to their campaign for that month.  As time goes on, and you become more familiar with their brand, their style, and their product, you’re going to get faster. You’ll also get more efficient at design work in general as you get more experience!  In this case, if you charge an hourly rate, you’re actually going to lose money as you get faster!  As an example, let’s assume you have 20 billable hours per week, charge $100 per hour, and at your current efficiency you can complete a project in 4 hours. That’s 5 projects completed per week giving you $400 in revenue per project.  As you become more efficient - under hourly pricing - here is what happens to your revenue per project.   Revenue per project as you become more efficient   This is not really fair, because you’re producing just as much - if not more - value as you were in the past. But your only option is to raise your hourly rate, which can get kind of messy. Do you raise it just for this client? Do you raise it across the board?  The other problem is that hourly rates set the tone for your relationship with your clients. When you charge an hourly rate, your client is effectively buying your time whenever they hire you - not buying the product you create, or the outcome you deliver.  This is a bit of a problem for your business, because you’re not just selling time. Time is essentially a commodity. If your client sees you as someone who sells time to them, then it’s hard for them to justify not finding someone else who will sell the same amount of time at a cheaper rate.  Finally, hourly rates can become an issue if you want to raise prices further down the track.

Finally, hourly rates can become an issue if you want to raise prices further down the track. Once you’re able to really produce quality work, efficiently, you may be better off charging fixed rates - because if you charge equivalent hourly rates, those rates are going to be really high. Clients might balk at paying an hourly rate of $300 or more, even if the total price is very affordable. So you can “hide” that hourly rate in a fixed price (more on that later).  Here’s a quick summary of the pros and cons of using an hourly rate as a freelancer.   Pros and cons of charging by the hour   A good choice for most early on Hourly rates are often a good place to start early on in your freelancing career. When you’re just starting out, you need to figure out where your work is going to come from, what kind of work you’re going to focus on, as well as getting all those background things set up (like a Hnry account!).  At the same time, hourly pricing is simple. You choose an hourly rate. You give an estimate based on that rate. You work, deliver a product, send an invoice. This saves up your time and energy for all those other things you need to focus on when you’re getting started.  But as you develop your business, and become more efficient and valuable to your clients, it might make sense to start looking at other ways of charging. There are, of course, lots of good use cases for hourly pricing - but if you’re sticking with an hourly model, make sure you’re doing so for the right reasons, rather than just doing so because it’s the way you’ve always done things.   Calculate your hourly rate     3: Charging a fixed rate Fixed rate pricing is exactly what it sounds like - it’s a specific piece of work for a set price. This pricing model is usually suited to freelancers who have been in the game for a few years and have some experience under their belts.  The main positives about a fixed-price arrangement are:  More income certainty for your business Potential to earn higher hourly rates  Hourly rates, in reverse Hourly rates offer predictable income rates, but they don’t reward efficiency. If you try to work on client work for 20 hours every week, and you estimate that a project will take 20 hours,","metadata":{"id":67}}],["68",{"pageContent":" rates  Hourly rates, in reverse Hourly rates offer predictable income rates, but they don’t reward efficiency. If you try to work on client work for 20 hours every week, and you estimate that a project will take 20 hours, you probably won’t schedule anything else for that week.  But what happens if you work faster than you expected, and deliver the project in 15 hours? If you can’t pull another project forward to fill the gap, you’re going to be short 5 hours of your hourly rate.  This is how fixed rates offer you more certainty. Let’s say you want to earn $1,000 per week. If you can book four small projects for $250 each, you are guaranteed to meet your income target - no matter how long they take you. There is a tradeoff here: in exchange for this income certainty, you sacrifice time predictability. We’ll get to that in a second.   Earn more in less time Again, this is the reverse of hourly rates. When you charge hourly rates, you get paid for every hour you’re working. But if you charge a fixed rate, you get rewarded for completing your work faster.  Let’s say you usually charge $100 an hour, and a typical project takes you 10 hours - so you earn around $1,000. If you change those projects to fixed rates of $1,000, and manage to complete them in 8 hours, then your hourly rate goes up to $125. If you can complete then in 5 hours, your effective hourly rate doubles to $200!  As you become more efficient - under fixed pricing - here is what happens to your hourly rate.   Fixed pricing: Your hourly rate as you become more efficient   Those are the two most compelling reasons to use fixed pricing. The big negative is that you take on more risk.  These are the three risks that come with fixed pricing:  Risk of pricing too low, and ending up with a low hourly rate. Risk of scope creep, where the project becomes bigger than you anticipated - again, dropping your hourly rate. Spending too much time on detailed proposals  Pricing too low This is the big risk of fixed pricing. Go back to that $50/hour example we just talked about. Let’s say you price a project at $500, expecting to take 10 hours to complete it. But this is really just a guess - it is hard to estimate how long","metadata":{"id":68}}],["69",{"pageContent":" Go back to that $50/hour example we just talked about. Let’s say you price a project at $500, expecting to take 10 hours to complete it. But this is really just a guess - it is hard to estimate how long a project will take (although it gets easier over time).  If you make a mistake, and you finish the project in 15 hours, your hourly rate just dropped to $33. If it takes 20 hours, your hourly rate will drop to $25.  On top of this, it’s going to be a stressful couple of weeks if you have other work to get to. Not only will you be earning a lower hourly rate than you’d like, you’ll also have to find time to fit in your other projects.  So pricing too low can make fixed price projects stressful and expensive for a freelancer.   Scope creep The other problem that can come up is scope creep. This is when the initial project you signed up for grows over the course of the project.  The first step towards avoiding scope creep is to have a really tight scope to begin with. Before you start working, be very clear about exactly what you are delivering, and when. You should also be clear about how many revisions your client gets included in the fixed price (if that’s applicable to your industry).  But there’s always a tradeoff to make. If a client asks for something small that was outside of your original agreement, it probably won’t hurt to add it on - you do have a relationship with your client, after all. But at the same time, those small things can add up. Next thing you know, your hourly rate is plummeting and you’re chasing your tail to complete other jobs.  A good way to stay on top of this is to track your time, even if you’re not billing on an hourly rate. This gives you a clear view of how much time you’ve spent on a project, and how much “slack” there is for any extras your client may ask for.  But it’s still a risk! Especially when it’s death by a thousand cuts, with lots of tiny additional changes that add up.   Detailed proposals This risk is related to the last one. To avoid scope creep, you need detailed proposals. But detailed proposals take time!

This takes","metadata":{"id":69}}],["70",{"pageContent":" the last one. To avoid scope creep, you need detailed proposals. But detailed proposals take time! You need to figure out what your client needs, put together a timeline and clear set of deliverables and put a price on all this. This takes time!  If you don’t account for this time in your price, you can end up in the situation we mentioned above - chasing your tail, earning a low hourly rate. This is especially true if your win rate is low - if you put together five detailed proposals, at three hours each, you’re going to have to recoup those 15 hours right out the gate. That’s tough to take, especially if you only win one or two of those projects.  So you need to find a balance. On one hand, you need to be clear in your proposals in order to limit scope creep. On the other hand, you can’t spend so much time on your proposals that your hourly rate plummets.  The chart below summarises the risks associated with the non-billable work required to make fixed-rate pricing work.   How your time is spend in a fixed rate model    Who is fixed pricing best for? Let’s quickly summarize the pros and cons of fixed rate pricing.   Pros and cons of a fixed pricing model   Given what we’ve discussed in this section, fixed rate pricing is best for freelancers with a couple of years of experience. This is for a few reasons.  First, experience gives you a much better idea of how long things take. This is something that you can really only learn by doing, so having a handful of projects under your belt will give you the insight you need to price your projects appropriately.  Second, a couple of years of freelancing will give you access to a lot of old proposals. Once you have these, you can start recycling bits of them into your new proposals. This helps deal with the problem of spending lots of time on each new proposal. When you don’t have to start from scratch on each one, you can save a lot of time, which really helps increase your hourly rate!  On top of this, fixed price arrangements work best for clear, closed-ended projects. They don’t work very well for vague, open-ended projects because these projects are very hard to scope ahead of time. If you’re going into an open-ended engagement, an hourly rate will probably be more suitable.   4: Package deals Package deals are a way of","metadata":{"id":70}}],["71",{"pageContent":" well for vague, open-ended projects because these projects are very hard to scope ahead of time. If you’re going into an open-ended engagement, an hourly rate will probably be more suitable.   4: Package deals Package deals are a way of reducing the time and effort of project scoping. Rather than negotiate a project’s scope with an individual client, you create a pre-defined set of deliverables ahead of time. Then, your potential clients can just choose whether they want these things or not.  It’s a bit like ordering from a menu at a restaurant. When you go to a restaurant, you don’t go to the kitchen and negotiate with the chef about what kind of food they’ll prepare for you, and how much it will cost. Rather, you just have a fixed set of options at a fixed series of prices.  Packaging your services is a similar approach. Like every pricing approach, it has some pros and some cons.   Spreading out your time The risks and benefits of packaged deals both come from the same place: spending a lot of time up front, in order to (hopefully!) save time down the track.  A package service is basically a proposal that you put together ahead of time. The big difference is that you don’t get to sit down and talk to your potential client about what they specifically need. This is where the risk comes from. If you spend time putting together a packaged service that nobody ends up buying, then that time was wasted.  However, if you put together a packaged service that people do buy, then you get the time saving benefits of having only put together the package once, rather than putting together a series of custom proposals.  Since you’re putting together an entire package rather than an individual project scope, you are probably going to spend more time defining and scoping that package than you would on an individual project. After all, you need to make it compelling (as it will have to stand on its own - you won’t have a conversation beforehand like you usually will with a bespoke project). What’s more, you need to make sure it’s really clear, so people know exactly what they’re getting, and scope doesn’t creep.  Let’s say you usually spend a day putting together a proposal. If you spend five days putting together a fixed-price package, you’ll need to sell that package five times before your time savings are worth it. But if you sell that same package ten times, you will have","metadata":{"id":71}}],["72",{"pageContent":" spend a day putting together a proposal. If you spend five days putting together a fixed-price package, you’ll need to sell that package five times before your time savings are worth it. But if you sell that same package ten times, you will have cut your proposal time per project in half - which means you’re also doubling your hourly rate for that portion of each project!   How is your time spent? It’s worth looking at where you’re spending your time in a package deals model. This chart should help understand the time efficiencies that you get with this model.  How your time is spent in a ‘package deals’ model   Compared to the fixed price model, you spend more time up front on scoping and packaging the service - before taking it to any potential clients.  Once the scoping is done, however, your return on that time investment is good - provided you get clients to buy the package! Sending a proposal using a package model takes virtually no time at all, and if your package scoping was effective then scope creep shouldn’t be as much of a pain point.  The big risk to this approach has to do with the time you spend scoping. If you misjudge demand for your packaged deal, then you may end up with few (or no) clients taking you up on it, and the time you spent scoping the package was wasted.   Reducing your risk You can reduce this risk by creating your packages in an iterative way. You can start with broad brush strokes that you offer to existing clients.  If you feel like one of your proposals could appeal to a wide range of clients, then copy that proposal and find another client to send it to - with some modification. Then repeat until you have a proposal that’s optimised and generic enough to be put to the general public. Then you can add things like a landing page on your website, marketing material, and other “bells and whistles.”   A higher hourly rate In addition to the time savings, there is also a significant upside to packaged services: the ability to increase your hourly rate.  The defining characteristic of a package service is that it is the same thing every time. The more repeatable you can make the project scope, the better.  This means that over time, you can get faster and faster at delivering the same value by selling the same packaged service to multiple clients.

You’ll figure out ways to become more efficient, you’ll find which parts of the service clients find the most valuable, and you’ll be able to deliver more value in less time.  This has the practical effect of increasing your hourly rate - and it’s a lot easier to do with packaged deals than it is for fixed price projects, because you’re doing the same thing over and over.  But we’ll talk in more detail about raising your rates later.  For now, let’s review the pros and cons of adopting a ‘package deals’ model.   Pros and cons of a ‘package deals’ model   Who is the ‘package deals’ model best for? Package deals are best for seasoned freelancers.  Before you can expect to succeed at creating a broadly appealing package offering, you need to have experience scoping, proposing, and delivering similar projects. That experience will tell you:  How to scope the project in a clear way (reducing scope creep risk) How much time it will take you to deliver the project from start to finish (to help you price the project) How to get a client excited about the project (marketing) What types of clients are looking for these services (marketing again) Again, you’ll have a backlog of old proposals you can refer to to help you scope and define your packages.  You’ll also notice that two of the above bullet points are marketing related. Experience is essential when it comes to marketing your package deals. An experienced freelancer will have a much better sense of how to sell their work - they’ll also have previous clients they can use for written testimonials, which are a great way of converting prospects into paying customers.   5: Setting your prices based on value Now that we’ve set a bare minimum (way back in section 1), and worked through some pricing models, we can now look at how you actually set a price.  It’s tempting to just charge a number that will help you meet the figure you arrived at in the first section of this guide. But you may be leaving a lot of opportunities behind if you do this.  Those numbers you figured in your bare minimum cover your costs, which include:the overheads from running your business; the hourly rate you “pay” yourself; and the money you ask for to compensate","metadata":{"id":73}}],["74",{"pageContent":" lot of opportunities behind if you do this.  Those numbers you figured in your bare minimum cover your costs, which include:the overheads from running your business; the hourly rate you “pay” yourself; and the money you ask for to compensate for the risk of being a freelancer.  Thinking of those figures as costs will help you separate their relationship to the price that you charge your customers. In reality, these costs are only relevant to you. For your customers, the price should be all about value.  Value comes from three places:  Your ability to increase revenue Your ability to cut costs Your emotional contribution You can think of this as a triangle.   The value triangle How you should think about value from your clients’ perspectives    If you take your minimum cost as a starting point, you can use these three factors to charge over and above that number, to gain some of the actual value you create for your clients - rather than just charge a figure that helps to meet your own costs.  All three of these things contribute to value. You don’t necessarily have to have all three as part of what you offer to clients, but you should be sure to position your offer in terms of at least one of these.  If you want to focus narrowly on one, you’ll need to do a really good job of it, as you’ll be vulnerable to other freelancers who can achieve two or three. Conversely, if you choose to do two or three, you’ll need to be careful not to spread yourself too thin.  The key is to be really honest with yourself about which of these areas you are strongest in - and then structure your services around them.  Let’s go over them in more detail.   Revenue gain and cost reduction These two are fairly self-explanatory. The more you can contribute to your client increasing revenue, and the more you can help to reduce a client’s costs, the more value you are adding. If you can figure this out, or even just estimate it, you can then try to set your price based on the numbers you come up with.  By thinking this way, you can better justify a price you come up with, and move the discussion away from your costs (like your hourly rate) and towards the value you’re actually creating for your client. After all, that’s what they’re buying at the end of the day.   Emotional contribution This one is harder to quantify, if it’s possible at all - but","metadata":{"id":74}}],["75",{"pageContent":" your hourly rate) and towards the value you’re actually creating for your client. After all, that’s what they’re buying at the end of the day.   Emotional contribution This one is harder to quantify, if it’s possible at all - but it’s also arguably the most important of the three pieces of the triangle. It’s the feeling your client gets from hiring you. This could be peace of mind, it could be less hassle, it could be the ability to advance their own career.  These things come less from your work itself, and more in how you conduct yourself. Things like:  Ability to deliver on time How easy you are to work with. Do you respond to emails? Do you huff and puff when briefs change? Do you have a good reputation? The reality is, things like this are going to contribute a lot of value compared to the “bottom line” benefits we talked about before. This makes a lot of sense when you scratch the surface of it. A mid-level person in a corporation or other large organisation is going to be embarrassed if they hire a freelancer who doesn’t deliver on time. That project is their responsibility, and it’s going to be their reputation that suffers.  If one freelancer consistently delivers on time, while another freelancer delivers at random times, but increases revenue a bit more or cuts costs a bit more, the mid-level person is still probably going to go with the freelancer who delivers on time.  So think about your client base, and the emotional contribution you offer them. Consider calling these things out in your pricing - after all, that’s what your clients are paying for.   Justifying your price Once you have identified how much you will focus on each of these three things, you can use them to justify your price. Rather than just give a price, give a price with an explanation. Explain how your solution is going to do each of these three things, and the value of them.  This approach lets you move away from pricing based on costs (which is limited to your costs) and towards pricing based on value, which is only limited by the amount of value you create for your clients.   6: Raising your rates If you’re good at what you do (you probably are!), you should be compensated for it.  That shouldn’t sound controversial.  Before you start raising your rates, however, it’s important to understand the economics - the supply and demand - of your business. ","metadata":{"id":75}}],["76",{"pageContent":" what you do (you probably are!), you should be compensated for it.  That shouldn’t sound controversial.  Before you start raising your rates, however, it’s important to understand the economics - the supply and demand - of your business.  Supply is the number of other freelancers who can do the exact same thing as you. The more of them there are, the less you’re going to have to charge to compete. Demand is how badly clients want your services. The more they want to work with you, the more you can charge.  To charge more, you need to have a strong position in at least one of these two factors:  the supply by offering service that few people other offer, or the demand by doing really good work - and telling people about it!  Pricing models and raising rates Technically, you can raise your rates on any pricing model. Partners in big law firms charge $1000+ an hour without blinking an eye. But in reality some models are more conducive to raising rates than others.  In an hourly model, it can be a bit of a challenge to raise your rates. That’s because once you’re really efficient and provide great value, your hourly rate can get so high that clients won’t be able to see past that number. They’ll balk at paying a high hourly rate, often without realising that your efficiency is built into that rate.  Packages and fixed price offerings are easier models for raising your rates. That’s because your time is an input, not an output. Clients aren’t buying your time - they’re buying the finished product you produce. Your time, plus your skills, plus your experience are all things that go into that finished product.  This is why it’s easier to raise your rates when you’re offering fixed price or package services. When you’re working under these pricing models, your time isn’t a consideration for your clients - all they need to do is figure out if the price you’re charging is worth it to them.  So if you want to raise your rates, your first move should be to move away from hourly pricing. This just makes everything easier.   Address the supply by dominating a niche You can’t change the number of other freelancers you’re competing against. But you can change the way you position your own business.  Let’s say you’re a graphic designer who does all sorts of things - brochures, web pages, sales presentations - you name it.

Let’s say you’re a graphic designer who does all sorts of things - brochures, web pages, sales presentations - you name it. You’re competing against a huge number of other graphic designers. In other words, the supply of graphic designers is really high. You’re competing against everyone who is offering to do these things.   Completing against all graphic designers   Instead, let’s say you decide to focus on a niche. For the sake of the argument, say you’re going to focus on sales presentations for software companies. By doing this, you have effectively reduced the number of other designers you’re competing against! Now, if a marketing manager at a software company needs a sales presentation designed for the sales team, they know exactly who to call - you are one of just a few people who can solve this narrow problem.  Our premium pricing will cost us clients from time to time; but if we are not losing business on price occasionally, we are not charging enough.  -The Win Without Pitching Manifesto   Competing against a small niche   Of course, this is a simplified economic view - in reality there’s a tradeoff here. If you promote yourself as a sales presentation designer, then people may not get in touch with you if they need a brochure or a landing page. Obviously the market’s demand for your niche services will be less than the demand for all graphic design work.  But the trade off could still work in your favour - depending on your industry. As a niche specialist, your work should be valued at a higher rate by members of that niche. If your new niche allows you to raise your rates enough, you should be able to compensate for the smaller amount of work you’ll get.  At the same time, remember that you’re just one person. You don’t need to take on that many projects per month to stay busy.   Address the demand by building your skills The other side of this is demand. Let’s stick with the sales presentation designer. That designer is still going to have some competition - there will be other designers who specialise in sales presentations, as well as agencies and other freelancers who don’t necessarily specialise, but do offer the same service.  While focusing on a niche helps a bit, that designer also needs to show how they are not just a sales presentation specialist, but is also the best sales","metadata":{"id":77}}],["78",{"pageContent":" and other freelancers who don’t necessarily specialise, but do offer the same service.  While focusing on a niche helps a bit, that designer also needs to show how they are not just a sales presentation specialist, but is also the best sales presentation specialist. This allows even more room to charge premium rates.  There are a few different ways to do this:  Make sure your portfolio is up to date with your best work. Get proof of results from happy clients, and turn these into testimonials. A nice-looking sales presentation is good, but a client saying you helped increase their sales by a significant percentage is better. Put together in-depth case studies showing your process and the results that process achieved. These things can help to increase demand for your services. And if you can increase demand, you can command a higher price.   Don’t forget the value triangle When you’re doing this, don’t forget the value triangle. Any testimonials or case studies should be in the context of that value triangle. Someone who reads one of them should walk away with a clear idea of the revenue you generated, the costs you saved or your emotional contribution. Or, of course, a range of these three.  This is how you reliably charge high rates - be very clear about the value you offer, and take deliberate steps to increase that value.   Further reading Pricing is a big topic.

You sit down at your kitchen table to do some work when you realise you haven’t put the trash out and there’s a forgotten load of wet washing in the machine. Half an hour and two chores later, you sit back down when your phone buzzes with social media notifications that just can’t wait.   At the end of the day, you look back and wonder where the hours have gone and how you managed to be so unproductive. While working from home has shown to increase productivity in some people, it’s also much easier to get distracted. Here are five tips to create more structure and routine to your workday at home.   1. Create a designated workspace The kitchen table only works as a desk for a few days, really. If you regularly work from home, do your spine a favour and invest in an ergonomic setup. Ergonomic experts suggest adopting a work posture, either sitting or standing, where you have a 90-degree bend in your arms to your keyboard, shoulders down, looking straight at your screen instead of at a downward angle.  If you have enough room in your home to have a separate workspace, take it and make it your own. Set up a desk with a","metadata":{"id":79}}],["80",{"pageContent":" your arms to your keyboard, shoulders down, looking straight at your screen instead of at a downward angle.  If you have enough room in your home to have a separate workspace, take it and make it your own. Set up a desk with a comfortable chair, preferably in front of a window with filtered light to avoid strain on your eyes from glare (it will also do your complexion a favour during video conferences). Add a plant or two (turns out they make us happier and more productive), and make the space comfortable and calming to work in. Set up speakers if you prefer to listen to music while working, or invest in sound-blocking headphones if you prefer dead silence.   2. Get “ready for work” in the morning Create a morning ritual to set the tone for the day before “commuting” to your desk. Have your cup of coffee or tea, make your bed (you’ll be more productive during the day if you do), get dressed and set a time to be at your desk. One study shows that the way we dress impacts our mood, so even if you prefer to work in your pyjamas, perhaps give wearing work clothes at home a go for a change and see how you feel.  It might help to put together a basket or bag of work-related items that you can carry to your workspace - whether that’d be the kitchen table or an office - to clearly define the start (and end) of your workday. Set a firm finishing time: close your laptop, put your to-do list on hold until the next morning and allow yourself to relax for the rest of the evening. Going for a walk or doing some exercise after you’ve finished work might help to transition into leisure time.    3. Set up a work schedule and stick to it Research shows that 29% of remote workers say they struggle with their work-life balance, and 31% say they have needed to take a day off for their mental health. Working from home is great for the flexibility and freedom it offers (not to mention the lack of commute), but remote workers are also more prone to burnout. Do yourself and your health a favour: agree with yourself on your hours of work and stick to them.  If you’re struggling to get through your daily to-do lists, perhaps prioritise tomorrow’s tasks either before you sign off for the day or before you start work in the morning.

If you’re struggling to get through your daily to-do lists, perhaps prioritise tomorrow’s tasks either before you sign off for the day or before you start work in the morning. That way you know you’ll have enough time to get the most important things done, and you won’t feel guilty for not being able to get to everything on your list (or worse, working through the evening to get them done).   4. Implement a productivity technique for focus Another effective way to stay productive during the day is to take breaks. It’s easy to forget to get up and move when you’re home alone without interruptions from colleagues. The Pomodoro Technique is a method you can use to work efficiently and focused for short amounts of time. With the Pomodoro Technique, you break your workday into 25-minute blocks, with five-minute breaks in between. You take a longer break of 15-20 minutes after four 25-minute blocks. So for instance, you could work until mid-morning, take a coffee break, work until lunch, have a bite to eat, work until mid-afternoon, go for a 30-minute walk, and finish the day with your last four Pomodoros (4x 25 minutes) before dinner.   5. Use productivity tools There’s a ton of tools out there to help you stay on track during the day. From time trackers such as Clockify and Toggl, to collaboration and project management tools such as Trello and Microsoft Teams, there’s a tool for every need. A little bit of research into the different options (and whether they’re free or not) will help you decide which one you might benefit from. If you find yourself easily distracted by the internet and social media, you can set up browser blockers such as StayFocusd or Limit (both Chrome extensions). Once added, you can set time limits on different sites or block them altogether. There are also several apps for iPhone or Android that feature Pomodoro timers so you don’t have to keep track of the minutes manually.    To wrap up Working from home has many benefits, but there are also pitfalls to avoid. Without colleagues and bosses around to tell you to take a break or go home, you’re in charge of making sure you find a work-life balance that works for you.

Structuring your day with the tips above will help you be more productive and focused on your work. We turned to freelance copywriter, Sam Grover, for his thoughts on why a sales pipeline is critical to your success as a freelancer. Sam also offers up his method of designing an effective pipeline that helps him to nurture leads and manage his workload.  Unpredictability is one of the most stressful things about being a freelancer. When is your next job coming in? How much will it be worth?  A sales pipeline can remove a lot of that unpredictability.  What is a sales pipeline anyway? The word “sales” is scary to lots of freelancers because it conjures up images of things like cold calls and chasing up people who aren’t interested in your service. For me, sales isn’t like that at all. Rather, sales is just about keeping track of your potential work, and systematically nudging it along.  The sales pipeline is the key component of that system. It’s just a list of all the work and potential work you have on. It’s called a pipeline because you have potential projects on one end, and finished, paid-for work on the other.  You probably have an informal system for this, where you just try to remember who you’ve been talking to and what your next steps are. By formalising this process and keeping it all in one place, you get much better direction about what you need to do today to keep yourself busy in the future.  How to build one You can just use a basic spreadsheet to build your sales pipeline. Here’s how mine works:  First, every project and potential project gets assigned one of six stages:  Prospects: these are people who I have proactively reached out to, or who have reached out to me to have a general conversation about doing some work. We haven’t figured out details like a specific project or budget. My goal with prospects is to work out the specifics of what they need, whether they want to work with me, and how much they want to spend. Scoped: these are specific projects that have been scoped out for a prospect. We have figured out a general budget, and figured out what they want to achieve. The next stage from here is for me to write a proposal. Proposal sent: These are exactly what they sound like: I’ve written","metadata":{"id":82}}],["83",{"pageContent":" scoped out for a prospect. We have figured out a general budget, and figured out what they want to achieve. The next stage from here is for me to write a proposal. Proposal sent: These are exactly what they sound like: I’ve written and sent a proposal, giving details around what I will do, cost and timings. My goal here is to get them to make a decision to either go ahead with the proposal, agree on changes to the proposal, or decline to move forward. Confirmed work: This is work that is either scheduled or underway. We’ve agreed what I’m going to do, a price, deadlines and other specific details. Completed work: This is work that has been finished and paid for. I don’t move someone into this category until the money has arrived in my bank account (thru Hnry, incidentally!). Inactive: These are people who fell out of the pipe at one of the stages before “confirmed work.” They either declined to move forward, or stayed in one stage for 90 days or more. Once this happens, I move them to “inactive,” and just keep in touch by sending them an email every six months or so. For each project, I have six pieces of information as column headers:  Name of the organisation Current stage Project details Date they entered current stage Date of last contact Number of days since they entered the current stage Number of days since last contact It looks like this:    (I use basic formulas to give me numbers for those two columns on the right-hand side. I’ll show you why that’s important in a second).  Then I use some formulas to count how many people I have in each of the six stages. That gives me a little dashboard that looks like this:    This shows me how busy I am right now, and, more importantly, how busy I will be in the future. As you can see, I’m pretty busy right now - seven pieces of work on the go! That’s great for the moment.  But if you look at the other stages, you get a different story. There’s not really many prospects, scoped projects or proposals to follow up on. This tells me that if I’m not careful, I’m going to end up sitting on my hands in a few weeks, once the 7 confirmed pieces of work are done and dusted.  So I have a few options:  Follow up the four outstanding proposals to see I can convert them","metadata":{"id":83}}],["84",{"pageContent":" I’m going to end up sitting on my hands in a few weeks, once the 7 confirmed pieces of work are done and dusted.  So I have a few options:  Follow up the four outstanding proposals to see I can convert them into confirmed work. Follow up the five prospects to try to turn them into scoped work. Email some people in the “inactive” stage and see if anything has changed. Do some cold-emailing (argh) The point is, my pipeline gives me visibility over the fact that while I’m busy now, I’m not going to be busy in a few weeks if I don’t take action now.  What kind of action to take? My sales pipeline can also tell me what action to take to best-use my time. This is where those “days since entered stage” and “days since last contact” come into play.  Here’s one example. This person is in the “prospecting” stage. He’s a marketing manager who got in touch with me to talk about writing some content for their sales team:    It’s been 33 days since we first spoke - quite a while! But as you can also see, I followed him up yesterday. So it would be pointless - not to mention a little creepy - to follow him up again today.  Now here’s another example. I sent this person a proposal to write their website more than a month ago:    They’ve taken a little while to get their ducks in a row, and I’ve been following them up routinely. But as you can see here, I haven’t followed them up for 17 days - nearly 3 weeks.  That means that a good use of my time would be to follow them up again today. Once I do that, their “days since last contact” will reset to 0, and I’ll give them a breather for a little while.  (And remember, once that “days since entered stage” number hits 90, this person will be moved to the “inactive” stage).  Make a habit The key here is to get into the habit of working in your sales pipeline every morning:  Add any new potential projects that have come in on their own (through referrals, website lead generations forms, etc.) Change the stage of any projects that have progressed since you last checked Follow up anyone who hasn’t been followed up in awhile.

This makes your business less stressful, more predictable and just generally more fun. Most contractors and freelancers don’t think about the full cost of sorting out their financial admin. Our financial admin calculator can help. A lot of people will just assume that the cost of their financial admin is simply the cost of hiring an accountant; however, there’s a lot more to it than that. The list below breaks down the key areas of cost, when it comes to your financial admin.  The main costs of financial admin: Accountant’s fees - If you hire an accountant or bookkeeper to help you with your taxes, you’ll be paying a monthly or annual fee. Usually a traditional accountant or bookkeeper will cost you in excess of $2,000 per year for Income Tax & GST calculations and tax filings (making the payments is all down to you though!). Accounting Software - These days, having to pay for, learn and use accounting software is mandatory if you hire a traditional accountant. Most accounting software charges a monthly subscription fee, that can range anywhere up to $50 per month and above. Spreadsheet/Office Software - Sometimes you will have to purchase a license for spreadsheets or other tools used for tracking your income and expenses. 3rd Party Invoicing and Expenses Apps - If you use a 3rd party app to manage your invoices or to store the receipts for your business expenses, then you’re probably paying an annual or monthly fee for access to that software. Your Own Time - This is a big one. From making manual internet banking payments, through to to reconciling accounting software and filing tax returns - this all costs you hours of your own time every month. As an independent professional, you’ll be acutely aware of the value of your own time. That’s time that could be far better spent with your friends and family, or working with your clients. But wait!

If I put my tax money into my savings and mortgage accounts, won’t the interest I earn offset those costs? Not really. Given that current Interest Rates are rock bottom, the amount of interest you might be able to earn is very low. Additionally, with IRD and ACC demanding payments at least every couple of months, the days of being able to store tax funds for months on end are a thing of the past. This means that you’re unlikely to pick up that lucrative ‘bonus interest’ on your savings accounts, awarded by the bank if you don’t make any withdrawals.  You can use our Financial Admin calculator to calculate how much interest you could earn if you put all your tax money in a high-interest savings account between payments (using a generous interest rate) - so you can see how much value you could conceivably generate from that effort.  Ready to find out how much your admin is costing you? Just use our calculator below to get the REAL totals 👇     Once you’ve seen the true cost of your Financial Admin, it can be hard to forget. A few years ago, the founders of Hnry got to exactly this stage. We realised that we were spending hours, and thousands of dollars each, just on our financial admin. That’s why we created Hnry - to take care of all the financial admin for contractors and freelancers, so that they could spend their time and money on far more useful things! One of the biggest myths about being a contactor is that it’s less stable than being a permanent employee. That’s true for some independent contractors, but if you know what you’re doing there’s plenty of work to be found. Here’s what we’re seeing successful contractors do to get work.   1. Master the Fundamentals Like in any sport, if you don’t have good fundamentals then you’ll never be able to compete.  For finding more contract work, here are the things you should already be doing:  Regularly improve and maintain a wide range of relevant skills. Keep your CV up-to-date. This is a no-brainer but is still neglected by many contractors. Be professional and considerate with your current employer. Their reference is the most important to potential employers. Start looking for new contracts about a month before your current contract is set to expire. Be open to short-term contracts. These can often lead to longer-term placements.

Start looking for new contracts about a month before your current contract is set to expire. Be open to short-term contracts. These can often lead to longer-term placements. Once you’ve got these fundamentals working for you, then you can start looking more aggressively for your next contract.   2. Make use of your network. Know what you want. Reach out to anyone you know (people you’ve worked with, friends and family, any contacts you may have in your personal directory) and inquire about any jobs that might be going. Chances are, if they know you, your skills and your experience, they might be able to connect you with people in their networks – and from there, things can start to really snowball.  There are few things to keep in mind when finding contract work through your existing network, however – primarily in how to interact with potential clients. When approaching someone for a potential work opportunity, either through a casual coffee meeting or on a more formal cold call, be very clear about what you want to get from them. A potential client’s time is incredibly valuable. The more you take note of and appreciate them taking the time to meet with you, the more you stand out as a potential contractor.   3. Get connected to some recruitment agencies. Recruitment agents are incredibly connected to companies and organisations that are actively looking for work. The sheer number of job openings and available candidates means going through a recruitment is most likely the most direct way of finding contract work, if your network leads turn up dry.  Find someone at a recruitment agency (it could even be as general as uploading an up-to-date CV to a known recruitment agency). Look for any opportunity to display your interest in a particular job.  How do you determine which recruitment agency to use? There are multiple types of recruitment agencies out there, ranging from IT recruitment to engineering recruitment, to hospitality. Understanding the type of work you’re looking for (or have come from) is a great first step. Are you looking for a long term placement? Or more of a short term contract? What type of contract work, industry, and organisations are you looking to be involved with? Check out the different types of recruitment agencies below.

As a freelancer, I often feel like I work in a vacuum. Generally I work alone, which means I don’t have a team around me to celebrate with. It also means I don’t have as many opportunities to network, which makes it challenging to grow my freelance work. But I’ve learnt how to overcome that challenge. Here are some of the steps and actions you can take to use networking to grow your freelance business.  Set networking goals based on business goals First things first: if you haven’t set business goals yet, go and do that now - and make sure they’re SMART. Business goals are crucial for finding purpose in your workday. Once you have established your business goals it’s much easier to set networking goals.  Let’s say one of your business goals is to get more clients. Your networking goal could be to attend x amount of (video) conferences in your field or niche to network with potential new clients. One of my business goals for next year is to increase brand awareness around my own brand. A networking goal I’ll be using to help me achieve this is connecting with other freelancers to share knowledge and resources.

A networking goal I’ll be using to help me achieve this is connecting with other freelancers to share knowledge and resources. Social media is great for this, especially in the current environment we’re all operating in.  As another example, maybe one of your business goals is to increase your own knowledge and skill set. Your networking goal could be to find a mentor to help guide you through the process and to teach you new skills. Mentors with in-depth experience in your industry can provide you with much-needed advice, a sense of community and a healthy dose of encouragement when you most need it. They can also help you more clearly identify your business goals and work through some of your business processes with you.  Think about different networking settings Once you’ve got your networking goals in place, take a moment to think about the different settings in which you can network, and how each one can help you get closer to reaching your overall business goals. There are the obvious ones, such as conferences, networking events, industry events, and joining your local business network group. But you can basically network anywhere, anytime. Twitter is fantastic for networking, and I’ve had several referrals and other network opportunities happen through the platform.  Instead of viewing networking as this “thing” you do on the side, it might help to take a more integrated approach. Depending on the type of freelancing you do, you could try to see opportunities everywhere, from the coffee shop you get your daily caffeine boost at, to the greengrocer around the corner. If you’re a freelance designer, for instance, you could see if said cafe needs a new logo. Or if you’re a freelance copywriter, you could ask your greengrocer if they need new marketing material. It has really helped me to view any business I interact with as a potential client.  Another strategy that has helped me a lot personally is to mention that you’re a freelancer, often, and to everyone. Talk about your work, drop it in conversation, find ways to mention it without being obnoxious or annoying. No one is going to know what you do for a living unless either they ask about it, or you mention it. And all little bits of help to raise your brand’s awareness and potentially gain new clients or start collaborations.

Come up with strategic collaborations that help spread the word about your business Let’s stick with the freelance writer example. If you’re viewing every business you interact with as a potential new client, it becomes easier to spot opportunities. For instance, you could find out if your local printer or even a national printer would want to collaborate with you. They could refer you as their recommended copywriter to clients who come in to get material printed, while you can hold up your end of the bargain by referring your clients who have printing needs to the local/national printer.  Once you’ve increased your brand’s awareness and you’re top of mind in your network for your specific skill set, you’ll be in a better position to be asked to work on paid collaboration projects. Joining forces with other freelancers on projects which encompass different skill sets and talents is a great way to offer clients the best and broadening your network in the process.  Whatever industry you freelance in, becoming an expert in your field will help to raise your personal brand’s awareness. Reach out to journalists, newsletter writers, and podcast presenters and see if they’re interested in interviewing you on a specific topic. That way you can enjoy the reach of someone else’s audience while providing a service of quality expert information on a particular subject.  Return the favour: referrals Are you a writer, but do you know a great photographer, builder, accountant, interior designer - you name it? Do them a favour and refer them to others when you have a chance. Word of mouth referrals are great for freelancers, as you’ve probably found yourself. You don’t have to wait until someone has referred you, for you to refer them. Being a matchmaker for your own clients or people in your network will be greatly appreciated by everyone involved!  One thing is paramount here though; only refer people who you know are great at what they do. It won’t be good for your reputation if you refer someone to a friend, acquaintance or client, and they fall short. Do your own due diligence and back up why you’re referring that person. Make sure you’ve worked with them and that they consistently produce high-quality work. The same goes the other way too, make sure you’re not recommending your fantastic fellow freelancer to a not-so-great client.

The same goes the other way too, make sure you’re not recommending your fantastic fellow freelancer to a not-so-great client.  In short, be proactive, share the Aroha, and don’t expect anything for referrals in return (other than good karma!). If you’ve worked with a freelancer, and you’ve liked their services, see if you could mention their name to a few of your contacts. You’ll be surprised how such a simple act of kindness can go such a long way. If a new client gets in contact with you, make sure to ask how they found out about your services. Then jump on text, email or phone to say a quick thank you to whoever was kind enough to refer you!  Wrapping it up Networking doesn’t have to be a laborious exercise, it can be as easy as striking up a conversation with a stranger next to you in line or the barista taking your order when you get your daily caffeine hit. Whether you’re thinking of adding networking to your mix of freelance activities to get new clients, or you’d like to expand your community with like-minded people, it’s worth the time investment to build on existing contacts and create new ones. If you start now, you’ll reap the benefits in no time! As a sole trader, there’s a lot to keep track of financially, from taxes to invoices, clients to cash flow, loans to levies – the list goes on and on. That’s why it’s so easy to relegate KiwiSaver to the bottom of the list; it’s a voluntary savings scheme, not something with a huge, compulsory deadline. And retirement is (for most people) a long way away. So you put it off, just for this year – you’ll get to it next year, you tell yourself.  And then you put it off again next year as well.  We’ve all been there. But what you might not know is that the later you wait to get started with KiwiSaver, the more you miss out on. There are some real benefits to taking part in the scheme, and if you’re not taking advantage of these benefits, you’re essentially leaving easy money on the table.  Because you don’t have an employer contributing to your KiwiSaver fund, it’s especially important that you understand how to make the most of it.

Because you don’t have an employer contributing to your KiwiSaver fund, it’s especially important that you understand how to make the most of it. Taking a bit of time now to get to grips with KiwiSaver could really pay off in the future – literally. Let’s get to it!  What is KiwiSaver? Why KiwiSaver rather than another savings scheme? What can you use KiwiSaver for? How to set up KiwiSaver as a sole trader Tl;dr: 5 top KiwiSaver tips Automate your KiwiSaver with Hnry   What is KiwiSaver? Let’s start at the very beginning. (A very good place to start).  In New Zealand, the age of retirement is 65. This doesn’t mean that everyone hands in their resignation letter on their 65th birthday; rather, it’s the age where superannuation and other pension payments begin.  NZ superannuation (super) is a universal weekly payment for all New Zealand citizens and residents aged 65 and up. You can start your super application when you’re 12 weeks out from your 65th birthday, and it’ll kick once you hit the 65 milestone. And unlike other government benefits, it’s yours whether you’re a pauper or a gazillionaire.  How much super you will receive depends on your situation – but even those who qualify for the highest super payments may struggle to live on it for the rest of their life. That’s why in 2007, the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) introduced KiwiSaver, as a supplementary, voluntary, work-based retirement savings scheme.  KiwiSaver was designed to encourage people to commit to a long-term savings plan, meaning they’d be more financially independent by the time their retirement rolled around. Whenever someone joins the workforce past the age of 18, they are automatically enrolled in the KiwiSaver scheme, and have to opt out if they don’t want to participate. (Sole traders have to opt themselves in as they don’t have an employer to do it for them – see below).  Believe it or not, KiwiSaver is the first of its kind globally – no other country (other than the UK, who started after us) has an auto-enrolment savings scheme like we do. It’s a fantastic system to","metadata":{"id":93}}],["94",{"pageContent":"  Believe it or not, KiwiSaver is the first of its kind globally – no other country (other than the UK, who started after us) has an auto-enrolment savings scheme like we do. It’s a fantastic system to help people prepare for retirement in the easiest way possible, and is one of the best ways to save.   Why KiwiSaver over another savings scheme? You could always stash your savings in a low-interest bank account, under your pillow, or in a hole your dog dug in the backyard. But sooner or later, inflation may mean that your money is worth less than it once was. What’s worth $50,000 today may be worth only $30,000 a few decades from now.  📖 Struggling with inflation in the here and now? We wrote an article on how to cope with inflation as a sole trader.  That’s what gives KiwiSaver the edge here – it’s actually an investment scheme. You pick a provider, and they’ll manage your money and invest your funds on your behalf, hopefully netting you massive gains in the process. These gains will then be invested along with the capital, which compounds your returns. Depending on the market, your money could grow exponentially, hopefully faster than inflation eats into its value.  But why KiwiSaver over another managed fund, say? Well, that’s entirely up to you, but there are a few benefits to using KiwiSaver that other investment options don’t have:   1. Government contributions  This one’s the biggie. For every $1 you contribute to your own fund, the government will contribute an additional $0.50, up to a maximum of $521 annually. Yes, even if you’re self-employed. This is the closest thing to free money we can think of.  To receive the maximum contribution, you’ll need to make sure you contribute at least $1,042 to your KiwiSaver fund in the 12 months before the cutoff date of June 30th each year.  $521 may not sound like much, but remember, this is an annual thing. Stay in KiwiSaver for the next twenty years, and you’ll have amassed a cool $10,420 in free KiwiSaver funds (not to mention the compound interest it may generate). It’s a great way to boost your balance!   2.

It’s a great way to boost your balance!   2. Employer contributions  This one’s not as relevant for sole traders, but it’s still useful to know about in case you ever go down the employment route. As long as an employee is contributing at least 3% of their earnings to their KiwiSaver account, employers have to contribute an additional 3% on top of their salary. It’s basically like a 3% pay raise, only you get to unlock it all once you retire.   3. It’s (mostly) locked away until you retire  If you’re that person who swears they won’t touch their savings, only to dip in to buy that brand-new mountain bike you’ve been pining after (we see you), this is a huge draw. Other than two specific exceptions, your KiwiSaver is pretty much inaccessible until you turn 65. You can’t be tempted to use it to fund your cycling addiction.   4. It can be a lower-cost managed fund  Depending on your provider and their fees, KiwiSaver schemes are generally cheaper than investing in other kinds of managed funds. Most KiwiSaver funds are also Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) funds, which have a maximum tax rate of 28% – meaning if you’re earning in the top tax bracket, you save!    What can you use KiwiSaver for? Your KiwiSaver funds are typically earmarked for your golden years – but there are two very specific exceptions.  You can use your KiwiSaver as a deposit for your first home. You will need to leave $1,000 in your account to continue accruing interest, so make sure to factor this into your calculations! If you fall into serious financial hardship, you can access your KiwiSaver funds to help you get back on your feet. For more information, visit the IRD website. Other than in these two circumstances, your money will be locked away until you turn 65.

You’re also entirely responsible for contributing to your own KiwiSaver fund, as you don’t have an employer doing it on your behalf!  The good news is that getting your KiwiSaver up and running doesn’t have to be a time-intensive thing. Take an hour or two out of your week at some point to set it up, and you’re done. Retirement ready.  Well, other than the obligatory British game show addiction and the biscuit tin full of sewing supplies.   Step 1: Choose your KiwiSaver provider and fund Depending on your needs, this might be the trickiest part of your KiwiSaver journey.  There are many different independent KiwiSaver providers, all offering different funds with different benefits. You may have to dig a little to find the fund that’s right for you.  Three things to keep in mind while doing your research:   1. The provider’s values Different KiwiSaver providers value different things. While some are definitely all about monetary growth, others aim for high returns while focusing on ethical investments.  If you have causes close to your heart, and the time to put in the research, picking the right KiwiSaver provider is a great way to put your money where your mouth is. Sorted have a fantastic KiwiSaver quiz that will help you narrow down the options.  📖 For more information on ethical KiwiSaver funds, check out this article from MoneyHub.  📖 You can also find a full list of KiwiSaver providers on the IRD website.   2. The risk profile of available funds Once you’ve decided on the right provider, it’s time to pick the right fund.  KiwiSaver funds are composed of a mixture of stocks and bonds from a range of different companies and entities. When you invest money in a fund, your money is spread out between them all, instead of just one.  Spreading money out like this is called diversifying, and it’s a good way to make sure you don’t lose everything all at once. If one of the stocks you invested in were to lose all its value, you’ll still have the money","metadata":{"id":96}}],["97",{"pageContent":" Spreading money out like this is called diversifying, and it’s a good way to make sure you don’t lose everything all at once. If one of the stocks you invested in were to lose all its value, you’ll still have the money invested in other assets.  KiwiSaver funds contain a mixture of high and low-risk investments. The mix of high and low risk investments in a single fund determines its overall risk profile. Basically, the lower the risk, the lower the return. But the higher the risk, the higher the potential reward.    You’ll need to choose the level of risk and reward that’s right for you.  If you expect to withdraw your savings within the next 3 years, a conservative fund could ensure you don’t lose money if the markets fall. If you are looking to withdraw in between 4-9 years, you might look at a more balanced fund. If your withdrawal is 10+ years away, investing in a growth fund over that timeframe could give you the best chance for the biggest returns. You should also take into account your own appetite for risk. If you hate the idea of huge losses, a growth fund might not be right for you – even if you have 20+ years to save for retirement.   3. Management and fees Some funds are actively managed, meaning there’s someone in charge of buying and selling stocks as the market fluctuates.  Other funds are passively managed – investments have been picked, and they’re unlikely to change, even if the market changes.  Generally, the more actively managed a fund is, the more fees there will be. Make sure you know exactly what you’re signing up for from the outset, so you don’t end up paying more than you’re comfortable with.    Step 2: Decide how much to contribute Now the hard part’s over, the fun begins!  You are the captain of your own ship, the SS Retirement, meaning you call the shots of when, and how much you contribute.   How much will you need? Having a goal may help make saving for retirement feel more real. If you know what you’re aiming for, you’re less likely to put it off!

Have a play with the numbers, until you get to a savings amount that feels right for you.   How much can you afford? How much you’d like to save is one thing, how much you can realistically afford to save is entirely different!  Take stock of your current financial situation. How much are you currently saving? Can any of that go into your KiwiSaver account?  We know finances can be tight for many sole traders. But anything you can set aside now could save you a financial crisis down the line.   Make contributions automatic Once you’ve decided on how much you can afford to set aside, it’s time to make those contributions automatic.  One of the biggest draws of KiwiSaver for PAYE employees (other than the whole being automatic enrolled thing, of course) is that their contributions are taken out of their paycheck before they’ve ever had time to see it. They don’t feel like they’re missing anything, because it never came through to begin with.  If you’re paid regularly, you can mimic this system by setting up a weekly or monthly automatic payment into your KiwiSaver. If it’s automatic, you’re less likely to notice or feel it.  If you earn sporadically, you might decide it’ll be easier to save a percentage of each pay instead. The easiest way to do this is through a Hnry allocation. Decide how much you want to contribute, set up an automatic allocation in our app, and you’re done!    Step 3: Check in every so often The last thing you might want to do is review your KiwiSaver fund when you need to. Maybe life has changed, and you have a bit more to set aside – you absolutely should!  Be prepared to see fluctuations in the value of your fund, especially if you’re investing in a growth fund. More often than not, this isn’t something to worry about – as the saying goes, time in the market is more important than timing the market. Over time, your money should grow.

Factor in the “motherhood” penalty When people take a break in earning, for whatever reason, they (and their employer) often stop contributing to their KiwiSaver account. This has become an especially big problem for women who take maternity leave – the “motherhood” penalty in New Zealand has been found to result in up to $318k less in retirement savings. If you or your partner takes parental leave, it’s worth having a discussion about the best way to continue contributing to both KiwiSaver accounts.

Your only guaranteed means of getting paid is by creating and sending an invoice yourself, unless your clients pay you directly via credit card or through buyer-created invoices. And unfortunately, unlike in a permanent job, invoicing as a sole trader won’t just start happening ‘automatically’.  Another reason why invoicing is so critical to your work is that the entire process of invoicing is a direct reflection of you and how you work – both during and after your work has been completed.  In other words, if you send a shabby invoice, your work will have a layer of unprofessionalism to it – no matter how good the service is that you provided. If you set a due date for the following day, your client might discredit your brilliant work because of how you handle your business admin. And if you’re not incredibly transparent and upfront about your fees, even inquiring about the ideal billing cycle before you start the job, you might be seen as inexperienced or even untrustworthy.  Contents In this invoicing guide we’ll address all of the important aspects to creating, sending, and following up on an invoice:  The Importance of a Good Invoice How to Craft an Effective Invoice Invoice Etiquette Getting the Most Out of Your Invoices Why Are Invoices So Important? Your invoices say a lot about you.  Imagine for a moment that you need to get some new carpet installed in the lounge of your house. You search online for a vetted tradie, maybe look for some reviews and take the time to make a calculated buyer’s decision. You hire someone who looks good, but it’s hard to see their track record over past jobs. “Oh well,” you think. “They look like they do good work.”  The tradie shows up and it’s true: they do really good work. They lay new carpet in the house in record time. But then you get slapped with an invoice the very next day: they’re charging you double what they had originally quoted, plus a convenience fee, a call-out fee, and to top it all off, they send you a digital invoice that looks to have been slathered with white-out and filled in with crudely hand-written values.  Will you hire this person again? Definitely not.  Will you recommend them to someone else? Well, maybe to someone you disliked.  No","metadata":{"id":100}}],["101",{"pageContent":" looks to have been slathered with white-out and filled in with crudely hand-written values.  Will you hire this person again? Definitely not.  Will you recommend them to someone else? Well, maybe to someone you disliked.  No matter how good your work, how efficient you produce a final product, you will have a hard time getting consistent work if your post-project business is conducted in a hasty and unprofessional way.  Put simply, the invoices you send (the way they look, when you send them, the payment options you offer the client) directly reflect the quality of your work and your working style.  In order to get invoicing done right, in a way that will maintain your relationships with current and future clients, follow these simple steps:  How to Craft an Effective Invoice There’s a lot to keep track of here, but we’ll break down the elements that make a good invoice into three sections: before you invoice, the invoice itself, and what to do after you send an invoice.  Before You Invoice Set Clear Expectations Before you start doing any work for a client, make sure they are aware of your rates (hourly/daily) and any additional fees you might charge (eg, ‘extra editing time’ or ‘call-out fees’). In some cases, a client will be happy to put a cap on the hours you complete for them, rather than pay for the individual tasks you complete. If you’re upfront about your pricing and the hours it will take to complete a task, it’s very likely that you’ll be able to charge those additional fees, where applicable.  Be Transparent If you require some upfront payment, this is also the time to disclose that information. Say you need 50% of the invoice paid ahead of time, in order to pay models for a photo shoot for a client: letting the client know about this ahead of time (while justifying the need for an upfront payment) is crucial in keeping your integrity and maintaining a transparent relationship with a client.  This is also an important moment in the process to determine who exactly you should be sending the invoice to. For work done at a large organisation, you should have on-file the email address of someone that will handle payroll. If you don’t have this information, it’s super important you find the contact details of someone at the organisation (even if you list a manager).

Try and set a date that’s far enough in the future where the client has flexibility in when they will pay, but close enough in time where they won’t forget to pay. The standard practice is to set a due date that is 21 days from the date of the invoice, giving your client 3 weeks to pay. What you set as an invoice due date (even a difference of a day or two) can actually have a very significant impact on how quickly your client will pay.  Sending an Invoice Once you’ve established timeframes for work and payment, and once the work has been completed, it’s time to get paid for real.  What do you need to include on your invoice? And what personal information do you need to give?  What is a reasonable invoice due date? Do you have timesheet information that will be incorporated into the invoice?  Will you list a logo and a trading name? Will you include multiple payment options? How will you ensure that you’re reimbursed for the necessary purchases you’ve made?  There are so many components to a good invoice, all of which we’ll go over in more detail now.  What to Include Tax Invoice vs. Invoice? These are two very different terms, and the distinction is straightforward: a ‘tax invoice’ is a document that includes an amount of tax owing as part of that particular invoice, while an ‘invoice’ is the total amount owed from the client to the payee, where there is no tax component.  If you’re registered for GST, you must add your GST number to all invoices you send. This will ensure that you’re collecting GST on your earnings, which you’ll then have to declare on a GST return to IRD on a regular basis (either bi- or six","metadata":{"id":102}}],["103",{"pageContent":" GST, you must add your GST number to all invoices you send. This will ensure that you’re collecting GST on your earnings, which you’ll then have to declare on a GST return to IRD on a regular basis (either bi- or six-monthly). Should you be registered for GST? If you will be earning over $60,000 in a year, you must register for GST.  If you’re GST-registered, you must include the phrase ‘tax invoice’ on your invoice.  If applicable, add a trading name and logo. Despite what you might hear out there, you actually don’t need to be registered as a business in order to use a trading name, logo or even a unique email address on your invoices. The need to register as a business is a common misconception for contractors and freelancers who are just starting out, and will only cause you to incur more burden along the way (ie, filing taxes for both you and your registered business). Having a trading name, logo, and all of the other nice things that come with your work as a sole trader are completely separate from the need to register as a business.  The client’s name. You can include the organisation or business name, or a person at said organisation that you know handles payroll. This is something you will have determined in the ‘pre-invoice’ step. It’s also a good idea to include the client’s address in this step, as well as any necessary information that the client uses to track invoices (such as a purchase order number).  A description of the services you provided the client, including:  The quantity of that service you provided. If you used any time recording software or tools to track your hours worked, you can include a link to a timesheet right there on the invoice. This will help provide justification to your client around the number of hours you completed. Timesheet templates Timesheet apps Unit price. How much is that rate? Are you charging daily or hourly? Do you have different rates for overtime or weekend work? If registered for GST, include the total price including GST and specify the amount of GST charged on that invoice) Payment methods and information  Clients like having the option to pay with a credit or debit card online, so if you have the choice, try and include that payment option on your invoices.

Moreover, if you pay for an account through a service like Stripe or Paypal, you might want to add these as payment options on your invoices.  Important: avoid accepting cash payments at all costs. These are hard to track and are a big red flag for IRD around tax time.  Add some other details, such as any necessary invoice comments and your contact information – your client might have questions or follow-up comments.  If your client or employer will be deducting Withholding Tax on your behalf before paying you, you will need to include your IRD Number within the invoice. You’ll also need to have previously provided your client or employer with a signed IR330C form specifying the rate of tax you would like them to deduct. When creating your invoice, you should not ‘discount’ the invoice by the percentage of Withholding Tax you elect - this is not correct from an audit perspective, and can lead to significant problems when you come to file your tax return at the end of the financial year. If your client or employer asks you to add a negative ‘Withholding Tax deduction’ line to your invoices, this is not correct procedure and is an incorrect use of an invoice.  Last but certainly not least, you might want to inject some of your personal tone & voice. Here’s an opportunity to reflect your individualism and creativity through a medium that is traditionally quite dull. The main challenge here is to emphasise your brand while maintaining that air of professionalism. Do keep in mind though, aside from the crucial criteria listed above, this step is purely optional.  If all of this is too much to keep track of, Hnry provides great invoicing software that will make creating and sending an effective invoice easy (and even a little bit fun).  Other Important Things to Include If you made any purchases during the course of the work, you can include these on the invoice in order to get reimbursed for them. You’ll need to have previously had these approved, along with a receipt or other form of Proof of Purchase (this could include a bank statement or e-receipt), before you add them to your invoice.  How do all of this work?

How do all of this work? When you do work for a client, there will naturally be some purchases you’ll need to make that are integral to the work you’re doing for them – expenses for which they have agreed to reimburse you in full. These expenses are not subject to tax deductions, and cannot also be raised as Business Expenses, as they are a full reimbursement for any costs you have incurred. Effectively, your client is making sure you are not out of pocket for anything purchased whilst working for them - so there are no tax reductions or tax relief applicable.  Invoice Etiquette: What to Do After the Invoice Has Been Sent This step in the invoicing process is maybe the most notoriously difficult to manage. You’ve sent the invoice and now you’re waiting to be paid.  What happens if your client doesn’t pay by that due date? What should you do? How do you follow up without appearing bothersome and risking damage to your work relationship?  According to some recent data, around 60% of individuals’ invoices are overdue when they get paid. That’s a staggering statistic, especially given that many of the clients that people contract with represent rather large businesses. It’s often the case that, with these large businesses, an invoice can slip through the cracks.  So how do you get paid on time while also limiting the number of invoice follow-ups?  If you have flexible payment options listed on your invoice, you can mitigate the risk that your invoice will be paid late. Another way to go about getting paid on time is to clearly and politely communicate with your client, both before or just after the invoice is sent, your timeframe for invoice pays.  With Hnry, we automatically send a follow-up email to your clients after the invoice has been marked overdue for more than two days. This allows you to focus entirely on the work, and it lets you maintain your relationship with that client moving forward. Rather than pestering them with emails yourself, you can just let them know that your ‘payment guys’ will be doing the pestering – not you.  Hnry Makes Invoicing Simple and Straightforward If all of the above makes you feel overwhelmed, you’re not alone. There’s a reason there are so many timesheet apps and templates, invoicing software solutions, and expense tools out there.

There’s a reason there are so many timesheet apps and templates, invoicing software solutions, and expense tools out there. But all of these solutions only actually solve a fraction of the problem: once you use software to create and send an invoice, you need another form of software to load your expenses – and there’s no one there to chase down late-paying invoices or store your payslips after the invoice has been paid. Moreover, most invoicing and accounting software hooks into your bank account and requires you to reconcile all of your own invoices yourself.
