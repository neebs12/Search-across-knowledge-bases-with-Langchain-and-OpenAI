Acknowledgments
As we developed the fifth edition of Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care, we
were inspired once again by Drs. McLaughlin
and Kaluzny. While we are very appreciative of
their contribution of the Preface, their contribution has been so much greater through the
years, as mentors and as colleagues.
We were also inspired by the thought
provoking Foreword written by Dr. Paul
Batalden where he outlined the model of CQI
in improving quality, safety, and value and
the model of coproduction in improving the
“value of the health care service contribution
to better health.”
We have benefited greatly from the feedback of students who have provided insight
and understanding of the importance of
making this book a practical teaching tool
that addresses the continuing challenges of
improving quality and safety of health care
in the future. We are most appreciative to our
friends and colleagues around the globe who
authored chapters. The coordination and integration of the contributing authors was a tremendous undertaking and we were privileged
to work with excellent colleagues, who are
truly expert practitioners of continuous quality improvement in health care.
The production of the book required a
team effort at all levels and in multiple locations. We would first like to acknowledge the
assistance and guidance of the editorial team at
Jones & Bartlett Learning. In Chapel Hill, special appreciation goes to Dean Barbara Rimer,
of the UNC Gillings School of Global Public
Health, whose leadership inspires a learning
environment that stimulates innovations and
viii

the motivation to pursue them. Deep appreciation is also given to the faculty and staff in
the Public Health Leadership Program at the
University of North Carolina and the Center
for Healthcare Studies and Surgical Outcomes
and Quality Improvement Center (SOQIC)
at Northwestern University with whom we
shared ideas that led to a better product. We
especially thank Dr. Rohit Ramaswamy, who
not only authored two chapters but also shared
his wisdom about the current and future
trends in CQI globally. Finally, we appreciate
the feedback and guidance that we received
from the readers of the Fourth Edition, which
among other things led us to reduce the number of chapters in this edition, but also gave us
the incentive to go into greater depth on some
of the new topics, such as implementation
science. While several chapters of the Fourth
Edition have been eliminated, we would like
to acknowledge several of the authors of those
chapters here, as the concepts (listed below)
were integrated into this edition’s remaining
chapters. They include:
■

■

■

Vaughn Upshaw and David Steffen—the
importance of the learning organization
concepts in CQI
Anna Schenck, Jill McArdle, and Robert
Weiser—the use of Medicare data in
CQI and the real-world example of the
Clemson Nursing Home Case Study
Curt McLaughlin and David Kibbe—the
importance of health information technology and understanding the strengths
and weaknesses of various data sources
used in CQI

Acknowledgments

Once again, as with CQI itself, the production of this book truly required teamwork
and we appreciate and acknowledge the vital

ix

role of all of our fellow team members, not the
least of which includes our families.

Preface

T

he first edition of Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care was
published in 1994. Continuous quality
improvement in health care was in its infancy.
Paul Batalden had kindly educated us, and
others, on his philosophy and groundbreaking
efforts at Hospital Corporation of America.
The Joint Commission had recently launched
the Agenda for Change. Within the larger
health care community there was interest as
well as skepticism as to whether manufacturing techniques that were popular and successful were applicable to health care. The obvious
need was to explain the basics and provide
documentation to illustrate its applicability
to health care organizations. The First Edition
provided the basics along with a series of cases
to illustrate its relevance to health care. A key
chapter was “Does TQM/CQI Really Work in
Health Care?”
By the Second Edition in 1999, the issues
of quality in health care had come of age with
the publication of the IOM report Crossing the
Quality Chasm. Many issues of implementation had become evident and a new key chapter
was “CQI, Transformation and the ‘Learning’
Organization.” At the same time the importance of such efforts was recognized by the
health care version of the National Malcolm
Baldrige Quality Award, whose standards were
included in the text.
The Third Edition in 2006 emphasized
measurement, especially outcomes measurement, as the use of CQI concepts expanded. It
also paid attention to information technology
that had the power to enhance implementation
and to disseminate results more widely. At the
same time the barriers to widespread adoption

xii

of the knowledge produced were evident.
The new cases on Intermountain Health Care
and the American Board of Pediatrics efforts
at organizational and professional learning
were featured illustrations.
The Fourth Edition in 2013 was under the
capable leadership of Bill Solliceto and Julie
Johnson. Its publication aligned with the passage of the Affordable Care Act expanding the
insurance coverage to 50 million people and
the role of the CMS to assess different delivery
models of care. It was a time of great expectations with emphasis on measurement and
the movement of these efforts into a number
of professional, governmental and international spheres. The CQI approach to quality
and quality improvement had now achieved
global prominence and led to the development of the companion volume, McLaughlin,
Johnson, & Sollecito, Implementing Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care: A
Global Casebook.
As the Fifth Edition goes to press, basic elements of the ACA have been dismantled and,
while quality improvement is a well-accepted
management tool, issues of institutionalization, measurement, implementation and adaptation to environments remain challenging.
One is tempted to conclude that not much has
changed; major segments of the population
are at risk of losing insurance coverage, interest in empirical evaluation of alternative care
models and quality improvement efforts has
slowed, and some evaluation studies on cost
savings of quality improvement have not met
expectations.
Over the past 25 years we have learned a lot
about quality improvement, its implementation

Preface

and the challenges and opportunities of quality and quality improvement as a core function
in health care. What has changed is the context within which health care is provided that
must be accommodated within future quality
improvement processes. Many of these contextual changes were un imaginable 25 years ago;
the sequencing of the genome and its implication for genomic medicine, the commercialization of health care, the consolidation of
heath care organizations on a massive scale,
and the introduction of new forms of provider
organizations, (e.g., ACOs, Walmart, and
Humana), the deprofessionalization of health
care providers, the basic demographics of the
population, and the types of care that will be
needed in the years ahead.
With these changes have come new issues
involving quality improvement:
■

■

■

■

Will the addition of ever more quality
and “value” measures turn attention away
from an overall culture of improvement?
Will people focus in on what is measured?
That is already one reason why health care
is great at increasing revenue, but not at
reducing waste.
Can we overcome the gaps between professional points of view? Or will we continue to have an attending specialist see
the story boards in the his unit as “something the nurses are doing?”
Will the institutionalization and professionalization of quality in ever large and
more complex institutions be relegated to
the quality officer/office rather than a fundamental responsibility of all personnel?
Will health care management recognize
that their departments and institutions
are part of a larger system of care? A system of care characterized by handoffs

xiii

that transcend organizational boundaries
involving an array of organizations and
providers with different professional and
organizational cultures yet critical to providing an integrated seamless care continuum from prevention to end of life.
These are not abstract academic issues.
These are real issues, involving real people, of
which we are all at risk. We know what it is like
to observe specialists exhibit mutual hostility
at the bedside because one didn’t comprehend
why the other demanded a prompt weekend consult, or wonder how a case manager
can expect an emotionally exhausted family,
following an extended and traumatic hospital stay, to select from a list of long term care
facilities without any guidance or insight about
the facilities. These experiences change your
perspective on quality, quality improvement
and the role of management in implementing
organizational structures and mechanisms
to assure interdisciplinary collaboration and
training hospital personnel to effectively manage the transition points in the care continuum.
As we enter an era of an aging population
and precision medicine supported by genomics and big data, the quality of care at the front
end will rapidly improve leaving the greater
challenges and the greater payoffs to society
in chronic and end-of-life care. What Deming, a pioneer in quality improvement, stated
50 years ago remains relevant today—that the
problems are with the system and the system
belongs to management. Our methods of quality improvement must encompass these larger,
increasingly relevant systems.

that have no right
to go away (Whyte, 2007).
This book invites two questions that may “have
no right to go away” in our journey toward
better health:
1.

▸

If we make improving quality, safety,
and value an “enterprise-wide effort,”
what do we need to know and do?
If we make improving the “value of
the health care service contribution
to better health” our focus, what do
we need to know and do?

Enterprise-Wide
Effort?

In response to this question, our attention
has been directed at the ways and structures
through which leaders lead organizations and
the way(s) organizations and their people
respond. In the last few decades, in addition
to work “inside,” we have been encouraged to
look outside of the health care services sector
to organization-wide efforts in automotive,
computer, aerospace, and elsewhere, where
great gains in quality, safety, and value have
been made. We have learned a great deal about
our own work: health care service as a system,
process; system leadership; measurement of
outcome; unwanted variation; system failure
and unreliability; organization-wide contributions to better health; making improvement
part of everyone’s job; accountability for better
performance and many other themes.
xiv

The First Edition of this book was published as we were deeply into these pursuits
and learning (McLaughlin & Kaluzny, 1994).
Several chapters in this edition of that book
honor this question and help identify what
might be known and done currently. Their
content helps frame important contributions
to leader development, selection, and performance assessment. In the short-term, following these chapters can offer today’s leaders
and organizations real substance in the performance of “leader and organization-wide work”
for the improvement of health care service.

Value of Health Care
Service Contribution
to Better Health?

This question invites focus on the words “service,” “value,” and “contribution.” It suggests
that we recognize that we are mainly in the
business of making services, that we are invited
to attend to the economic value of our efforts
and that we acknowledge that our services are
best thought of as a contribution to health.

Service
Victor Fuchs in his early review of the emerging service economy noted that making a
service was different from making a product
(Fuchs, 1968). Services always required the
active participation, insight from two parties:
the professional and the beneficiary. Vincent
and Elinor Ostrom were the first to call that

phenomenon “coproduction.”4 Building on
the work of Lusch and Vargo (2014), Osborne,
Radnor, and Nasi suggested that a “productdominant logic” had overtaken a clearer view
of the logic involved in making a service.6
Building on these ideas of “service” and how
“making a service” might be different from
“making a product,” Batalden and colleagues
offered a description of the coproduction of
health care service and a model for understanding and use, as illustrated in FIGURE 1
(Batalden, Batalden, Margolis, et al., 2016).
The model invited attention to the interactions of patients and professionals. It suggested that a variety of interactions might
be possible, ranging from “civil discourse”
to “co-execution.” It recognized that these
interactions occurred partly within an openly
bounded health care system and in the context of social and community systems. This

variety of interaction depended in part on
the knowledge, skill, habits and willingness
to be vulnerable as the parties engaged in the
relationships and actions that characterized a
health care service.
These insights formed the basis of a
clearer idea of the interdependent work of
two groups of people, some of whom might
be named “patients” and some named as
“professionals”—though in reality they each
brought different expertise to their shared
interactions.
If we really mean that health care services are “coproduced,” new tools that enable
visualization and design that reflect the contribution of patients and professionals will
be helpful. The measurement of process and
result will need to reflect both the implementation and effect of the professional’s scienceinformed practice (Greenhalgh, 2018) and

xvi

Foreword

the methods of addressing and the degree of
attainment of the patient’s goal.
But not all health professional work seems
to fit this service logic. Sometimes the health
care work seems to better fit “making a product.” Helping professionals know when to use
which logic—service-making or productmaking—will open new approaches to design,
as well as professional education, development.

Value
Øystein Fjeldstad has suggested that multiple
system architectures might be useful to create
value in modern service-making. He includes
the development of standardized responses to
commonly occurring needs in linked processes
(value chains), customized responses to particular needs (value shop), and flexible responses
to emergent needs (value network) (Stabel &
Fjeldstad, 1998; Fjeldstad, Snow, Miles, Lettl,
2012). Using this typology one can begin to
imagine the opportunity to link them in ways
that match need and system form. Much more
development of these multiple ways of creating
value seems likely.

Contribution
This word invites us to remember that a person’s health is not easy to “outsource” to a
professional. At best, the health professional’s
coproduced service makes a contribution to
further another person’s health. Recognizing
that the shared work is a contribution to health,
invites inquiry into patient need, patient assets,
patient supports, patient knowledge & skill,
patient’s lived reality as part of the understanding for service coproduction design. A similar
inventory of knowledge, skill, habits, capability and interest of professionals seems in
order. Even the professional-patient relationship itself could be explored for its capability
in contributing to the process of coproducing
a service. Assessments of the role that other
complementary resources & services, such as

social services must become even more clear
and reliable as we use and integrate them with
health care services for “improved outcomes”
(Bradley & Taylor, 2015).
With this edition, the editors point to the
future of the second question and have opened
this space for readers (Chapter 14).

▸

In Summary

Both questions seem to have “patiently waited
for us” in the poet’s words (Whyte, 2007). They
both invite strategic thinking and aligned professional action. Both recognize that “knowing” alone is not sufficient. Books like this can
invite knowing and doing, but it is the reader
who makes things happen. Enjoy the authors
and editors’ words in this book but enjoy
their intent in the work of an informed, acting reader even more. Let me close with Mary
Oliver’s words (Oliver, 2005):
What I Have Learned So Far
Meditation is old and honorable, so why
should I not sit, every morning of
my life, on the hillside, looking into
the shining world? Because, properly
attended to, delight, as well as havoc,
is suggestion. Can one be passionate
about the just, the ideal, the sublime,
and the holy, and yet commit to no
labor in its cause? I don’t think so.
All summations have a beginning, all effect
has a story, all kindness begins with
the sown seed. Thought buds toward
radiance. The gospel of light is the
crossroads of—indolence, or action.
Be ignited, or be gone.

Global Health Services
William A. Sollecito and Julie K. Johnson
We are here to make another world.
—W. Edwards Deming

C

ontinuous quality improvement (CQI)
comes in a variety of shapes, colors, and
sizes and has been referred to by many
names. It is an example of the evolutionary
process that started with industrial applications, primarily in Japan, and has now spread
throughout the world, affecting many economic
sectors, including health care. In this introductory chapter, we define CQI, trace its history
and adaptation to health care, and consider its
ongoing evolution. References to subsequent
chapters and a previously published volume of
case studies (McLaughlin, Johnson, & Sollecito,

2012) provide greater detail and illustrations
of CQI approaches and successes as applied to
health care.
Despite the evolution and significant progress in the adoption of CQI theory, methods,
and applications, the need for greater efforts in
quality improvement in health care continues
unabated. For example, a major study from 2010
encompassing more than 2,300 admissions in
10 North Carolina hospitals demonstrated that
much more needs be done to improve the quality and safety in U.S. hospitals, and it may have
implications for health care globally. It found
that “patient harms,” including preventable
medical errors and other patient safety measures, remained common with little evidence
of improvement during the 6-year study period
1

2

Chapter 1 The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement

from 2002 to 2007 (Landrigan et al., 2010). In
recent years, there has been substantial progress in the greater diffusion of CQI in health
care in certain sectors. For example, there has
been broader institutionalization of CQI in public health in the United States, much of which
can be attributed to the broader application of
accreditation requirements; this is described in
Chapters 11 and 12. Great progress has also been
seen in the broader adoption of CQI in resourcepoor countries, as documented in Chapter 13.
However, with greater complexity in health care
comes greater challenges; for example, greater
uses of technology bring benefits and risks, as
described in Chapter 4, and more widespread
applications of evidence-based interventions
do not necessarily provide improved outcomes
(Wandersman, Alia, Cook, Hsu, & Ramaswamy,
2016). As a result, the challenge of how to cross
the quality chasm (Institute of Medicine [IOM],
2001) in health care clearly remains, and our
goal in this text is to help to shed light on the
scope of the problem and potential solutions.

Effective. Providing services
based on scientific knowledge
and evidence-based guidelines.
Timely. Reducing delays in providing and receiving health care.
Efficient. Delivering health care
in a manner that maximizes
resource use and avoids waste.
Equitable. Delivering health
care that does not differ in quality according to personal characteristics such as gender, race,
ethnicity, geographical location,
or socioeconomic status.
People-centered. Providing care
that takes into account the preferences and aspirations of individual service users and the culture of
their community (World Health
Organization, 2017).

Quality Assurance
▸

Definitions

Quality in Health Care
The exact definition of quality in health care
varies somewhat for the various sectors of
health care. The World Health Organization
(WHO) provides a broad-based definition that
encompasses global health care as:
“the extent to which health care services provided to individuals and
patient populations improve desired
health outcomes. In order to achieve
this, health care must be safe, effective, timely, efficient, equitable and
people-centered.”
Safe. Delivering health care that
minimizes risks and harm to
service users, including avoiding
preventable injuries and reducing medical errors.

Quality assurance (QA) is closely related to, and
sometimes confused with, CQI. QA focuses
on conformance quality, which is defined as
“conforming to specifications; having a product or service that meets predefined standards”
(McLaughlin & Kaluzny, 2006, p. 37). QA is
sometimes the primary goal of accreditation
processes, for example in the 1980s and 90s
hospital accreditation by the Joint Commission
on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations
(JCAHO) now known as The Joint Commission
(TJC) was primarily focused on meeting predefined standards (i.e., QA). More recently, especially in public health, accreditation is intended
to promote CQI (see Chapters 11 and 12). QA is
sometimes included in broader CQI initiatives
as a way of defining baseline care, as an interim
goal or as part of the process definition, but CQI
is much broader in its goals than QA.
A related concept that should be mentioned briefly is quality control (QC), which
was widely used in the early development of

Definitions

procedures to ensure industrial product quality. Various definitions can be found for this
term (Spath & Kelly, 2017), and in some cases,
QC is confused with QA. It is our experience
that QC is synonymous with inspection of
products or other process outputs with the
goal of determining which products should be
rejected and/or reworked, often accompanied
by counting the number of “defects.” The role
and weaknesses of inspection (in comparison
to CQI) are further discussed by Ross (2014) as
part of the evolutionary development of CQI.

CQI usually involves a common set of characteristics, which include the following:
■

Continuous Quality
Improvement (CQI)
A succinct but accurate definition of CQI
in health care is: “the combined efforts of
everyone—health care professionals, patients
and their families, researchers, payers, planners and educators—to make changes that will
lead to better patient outcomes (health), better
system performance (care) and better professional development (learning)” (Batalden &
Davidoff, 2007, p. 2).
To expand on that definition, for example
to include public health, and describe how this
term has led to a broad movement, we provide
a bit of history. What was originally called total
quality management (TQM) in the manufacturing industry evolved into CQI as it was applied
to health care administrative and clinical processes. Over time, the term continued to evolve,
and now the same concepts and activities are
referred to as quality improvement or quality management, or even sometimes simply as
improvement, as in the Model for Improvement
(Langley et al., 2009). Except when we refer to
specific historical examples, the terms CQI and
QI will be used primarily throughout this text.
In health care, a broader definition of
CQI and its components is this: CQI is a
structured organizational process for involving
personnel in planning and executing a continuous flow of improvements to provide quality
health care that meets or exceeds expectations.

Under its various labels, CQI is both an

four broad types of performance improvement initiatives undertaken within a given
institution:

Localized improvement efforts
Organizational learning
Process reengineering
Evidence-based practice and
management

Localized improvement occurs when an ad
hoc team is developed to look at a specific process problem or opportunity. Organizational
learning occurs when this process is documented
and results in the development of policies and
procedures, which are then implemented. Examples include the development of protocols, procedures, clinical pathways, and so on. Process
reengineering occurs when a major investment
blends internal and external resources to make
changes, often including the development of
information systems, which radically impact key
organizational processes. Evidence-based practice and management involve the selection of

4

Chapter 1 The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement

best health and management practices; these are
determined by examination of the professional
literature and consideration of internal experience, and more recently, especially in public
health, accreditation requirements. The lines of
demarcation between these four initiatives are
not clear because performance improvement can
occur across a continuum of project size, impact,
content, external consultant involvement, and
departure from existing norms.

Societal Learning
In recent years, the emphasis on quality has
increased at the societal level. The Institute
of Medicine (IOM) (now called the U.S.
National Academy of Medicine) has issued
a number of reports critical of the quality of
care and the variability of both quality and
cost across the country (IOM, 2000, 2001).
This concern has increased with mounting
evidence of the societal cost of poor-quality
care in both lives and dollars (Brennan et al.,
2004). It builds on the pioneering work of
Phillip Crosby (1979), who provided a focus
on the role of cost in quality initiatives that
is quite relevant today. Crosby’s writings
emphasize developing an estimate of the
cost of nonconformance, also called the cost
of quality. Developing this estimate involves
identifying and assigning values to all of the
unnecessary costs associated with waste and
wasted effort when work is not done correctly the first time. This includes the costs
of identifying errors, correcting them, and
making up for the customer dissatisfaction
that results. Estimates of the cost of poor
quality range from 20–40% of the total costs
of the industry, a range widely accepted by
hospital administrators and other health
care experts.
This view leads naturally to a broadening of the definition of quality by introducing
the concept of adding value, in addition to
ensuring the highest quality of care, implying
greater accountability and a cost benefit to

enhance the decision-making and evaluation
aspects of CQI initiatives. This concept has
seen a resurgence in recent years as national
health plans, for example in the United States
and the United Kingdom, look to minimize
cost and increase value while providing the
highest quality of care. For example, several
leading experts propose refocusing on quality and accountability simultaneously, noting
that “improving the U.S. health care system
requires simultaneous pursuit of three aims:
improving the experience of care, improving
the health of populations, and reducing per
capita costs of health care” (Berwick, Nolan, &
Whittington, 2008, p. 759). These same sentiments are echoed by Robert Brook of the
RAND Corporation, who proposes that the
future of CQI in health care requires a focus
on the concept of value, with consideration of
both cost and quality (Brook, 2010).
Most recently, a large-scale reinforcement of these concepts in the United States is
found in the goals of the Affordable Care Act
(ACA), which jointly emphasizes improvements to access, quality of care, and cost
reduction. Although some progress can be
attributed to the ACA for example, in regard
to lowering hospital acquired infections and
readmissions—achievement of its long-term
goals is still a work in progress (Blumenthal,
Abrams, & Nuzum, 2015; Somander, 2015).
These concepts are discussed in greater detail
throughout this book, particularly in the final
chapter (Chapter 14). Concerns about linking
quality and value are not limited to the United
States; similar evidence and concerns have been
reported from the United Kingdom, Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand (Baker et al., 2004;
Davis et al., 2002; Kable, Gibbard, & Spigelman,
2002). This emphasis has played out in studies,
commissions, and reports as well as the efforts
of regulatory organizations to institutionalize
quality through their standards and certification processes. As you will see throughout this
book, concern for quality and cost is a matter
of public policy.

Rationale and Distinguishing Characteristics

Professional Responsibility
Health care as a whole is often likened to a
cottage industry with overtones of a medieval
craft guild, with a bias toward treatment rather
than prevention and a monopoly of access to
and implementation of technical knowledge.
This system reached its zenith in the mid20th century and has been under pressure ever
since (McLaughlin & Kaluzny, 2002; Rastegar,
2004; Schlesinger, 2002; Starr, 1982). It is reinforced by the concept of professionalism, by
which service providers are assumed to have
exclusive access to knowledge and competence and, therefore, take full responsibility
for self-regulation and for quality. However,
much of the public policy debate has centered
on the weaknesses of the professional system
in improving quality of care. Critics point to
excessive professional autonomy; protectionist guild practices, such as secrecy, restricted
entry, and scapegoating; lack of capital accumulation for modernization; and economic
self-interest as major problems. As we will
see, all of these issues impinge on the search
for improved quality. However, we cannot
ignore the role of professional development
as a potential engine of quality improvement,
despite the popular emphasis on institutional
improvement and societal learning. This, too,
will be addressed in subsequent chapters.

▸

Rationale and
Distinguishing
Characteristics

As health care organizations and professions
develop their own performance improvement
approaches, their management must lead
them through a decision process in which
activities are initiated, adapted, and then institutionalized. Organizations embark on CQI
for a variety of reasons, including accreditation requirements, cost control, competition

5

for customers, and pressure from employers
and payers. Linder (1991), for example, suggests that there are three basic CQI strategies:
true process improvement, competitive advantage, and conformance to requirements. Some
institutions genuinely desire to maximize their
quality of care as defined in both technical and
customer preference terms. Others wish simply to increase their share of the local health
care market. Still others wish to do whatever
is necessary to maintain their accreditation
status with bodies such as TJC, National
Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA),
and others, after which they will return to
business as usual. As you might imagine, this
book is written for the first group—those who
truly wish to improve their processes and
excel in the competitive health care market
by giving their customers the quality care that
they deserve.
Although CQI comes in a variety of
forms and is initiated for a variety of reasons,
it does have distinguishing characteristics and
functions. These characteristics and functions are often defined as the essence of good
management and leadership. They include:
(1) understanding and adapting to the external
environment; (2) empowering clinicians and
managers to analyze and improve processes;
(3) adopting a norm that the term customer
includes both patients and providers and that
customer preferences are important determinants of quality in the process; (4) developing
a multidisciplinary approach that goes beyond
conventional departmental and professional
lines; (5) adopting a planned, articulated philosophy of ongoing change and adaptation;
(6) setting up mechanisms to ensure implementation of best practices through planned
organizational learning; (7) providing the
motivation for a rational, data-based, cooperative approach to process analysis and change;
and (8) developing a culture that promotes all
of the above (see Chapter 2).
The most radical departure from past
health care improvement efforts is a willingness

6

Chapter 1 The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement

to examine existing health care processes and
rework these processes collaboratively using
state-of-the-art scientific and administrative
knowledge and relevant data-gathering and
analysis methodologies. Many health care
processes developed and expanded in a complex, political, and authoritarian environment,
acquiring the patina of science. The application of data-based management and scientific
principles to the clinical and administrative
processes that produce patient care is what
CQI is all about. Even with all the public concern about medical errors and patient safety,
improvement cannot occur without both
institutional will and professional leadership
(Millenson, 2003).
CQI is simultaneously two things: a
management philosophy and a management
method. It is distinguished by the recognition
that customer requirements are the key to customer quality and that customer requirements
ultimately will change over time because
of changes in evidence-based practices and
associated changes in education, economics, technology, and culture. Such changes,
in turn, require continuous improvements in
the administrative and clinical methods that
affect the quality of patient care and population health. This dynamic between changing
expectations and continuous efforts to meet
these expectations is captured in the Japanese
word kaizen, translated as “continuous
improvement” (Imai, 1986). Change is fundamental to the health care environment, and the
organization’s systems must have both the will
and the way to master such change effectively.

Customer Focus
The use of the term customer presents a special
challenge to many health professionals (Houpt,
Gilkey, & Ehringhaus, 2015). For many, it is a
term that runs contrary to the professional
model of health services and the idea that “the
doctor knows best.” Some health professionals would prefer terms that connote the more
dependent roles of client or patient. In some

cases, it is professional pride about caring for
patients and their families that causes disdain
for the term customer. In CQI terms, customer
is a generic term referring to the end user of
a group’s output or product. The customer
can be external or internal to the system—a
patient, a payer, a colleague, or someone from
another department. User satisfaction then
becomes one ultimate test of process and product quality. Consequently, new efforts and new
resources must be devoted to ascertaining what
the customer wants through the use of consumer surveys, focus groups, interviews, and
various other ways of gathering information
on customer preferences, expectations, and
perceived experiences. Chapter 4 addresses
some of the issues surrounding current methods for “surveying” customers to measure satisfaction, and Chapter 7 discusses the role of
the patient in quality and safety.

System Focus
CQI is further distinguished by its emphasis on
avoiding personal blame. The focus is on managerial and professional processes associated
with a specific outcome—that is, the entire
production system. The initial assumption is
that the process needs to be changed and the
persons already involved in that process are
needed to help identify how to approach a
given problem or opportunity.
Therefore, CQI moves beyond the ideas
of participative management and decentralized organizations. It is, however, participative in that it encourages the involvement
of all personnel associated with a particular
work process to provide relevant information
and become part of the solution. CQI is also
decentralized in that it places responsibility
for ownership of each process in the hands of
its implementers, those most directly involved
with it. Yet this level of participation and
decentralization does not absolve management of its fundamental responsibility; in fact,
it places additional burdens on management.
In situations where the problem is within

Rationale and Distinguishing Characteristics

the system (usually the case), management is
responsible for change. CQI calls for significant amounts of managerial thought, oversight, flexibility, and responsibility.
CQI inherently increases the dignity of
the employees involved because it not only
recognizes the important role belonging to
each member of the process improvement
team, but it also involves them as partners and
even leaders in the redesign of the process.
In some cases, professionals can also serve
as consultants to other teams as well as to
management. Not surprisingly, organizations
using CQI often experience improvements in
morale (intrinsic motivation) and higher levels of engagement. When the level of quality is
being measured, workers can rightly take pride
in the quality of the work they are producing.
The importance of motivation and engagement to CQI efforts is discussed in greater
detail in Chapter 2.
Another important aspect of having a
systems focus is the recognition that health
care systems are dynamically complex and
can include many organizations, both large
(macro-) systems and small (micro-) systems
(see Chapters 6 and 9). An important part
of a systems focus is the understanding
that improving quality and safety of complex systems requires systems thinking (see
Chapter 2), a management discipline that
“acknowledges the large number of parts in a
system, the infinite number of ways in which
the parts interact and the nature of the interactions” (Spath & Kelly, 2017, p. 44). See Ross
(2014) for further description of the components of systems thinking.

Measurement and
Decision Making
Another distinguishing feature of CQI is the
rigorous belief in fact-based learning and decision making, captured by Deming’s saying, “In
God we trust. All others bring data.” Facts do
include perceptions, and decisions cannot all be

7

delayed to await the results of scientifically correct, double-blind studies. However, everyone
involved in CQI activities is expected to study
the multiple causes of events and to explore a
wide array of system-wide solutions. The primary purpose of data and measurement in CQI
is learning—how to make system improvements and what the impact of each change that
we have already made has had on the overall
system. Measurement is not intended to be used
for selection, reward, or punishment (Berwick,
1996). It is surprising and rewarding to see a
team move away from the table-pounding “I’m
right and you’re stupid” position (with which
so many meetings in health care start) by gathering data, both qualitative and quantitative
data, to see what is actually happening and
why. Multiple causation is assumed, and the
search for answers starts with trying to identify
the full set of factors contributing to less-thanoptimal system performance.
The inherent barriers that accompany
CQI implementation include the tension
between the professionals’ need for autonomy and control and the objectives of organizational learning and conformance to best
practices. Organizations can also oversimplify
their environment, as sometimes happens
with clinical pathways. Seriously ill patients
or patients with multiple chronic conditions
do not fit the simple diagnoses often assumed
when developing such pathways; a traditional
disease-management approach may not suffice, and a broader chronic-care model that
incorporates a personalized approach may be
necessary (See Chapter 7). There may also be
a related tendency to try to over control processes. Health care is not like manufacturing,
and it is necessary to understand that patients
(anatomy, physiology, psyche, and family setting), providers, and diagnostic categories are
highly variable—and that variance reduction
can only go so far. One must develop systems
that properly handle the inherent variability
(called common-cause variability) after unnecessary variability (called special-cause variability) has been removed (McLaughlin, 1996).

Elements of CQI

7.

Together with these distinguishing characteristics, CQI in health care is usually composed
of a number of elements, including:
■

■

■

Philosophical elements, which for the
most part mirror the distinguishing characteristics cited previously
Structural elements, which are usually
associated with both industrial and professional quality improvement programs
Health specific elements, which add the
specialized knowledge of health care and
public health to the generic CQI approach

Philosophical Elements
The philosophical elements are those aspects
of CQI that, at a minimum, must be present in
order to constitute a CQI effort. They include:
1.

2.

3.

4.

5.

6.

Strategic focus—Emphasis on having
a vision/mission, values, and objectives that performance improvement
processes are designed, prioritized,
and implemented to support
Customer focus—Emphasis on
both customer (patient, provider,
payer) satisfaction and health outcomes as performance measures
Systems view—Emphasis on analysis of the whole system providing a
service or influencing an outcome
and practicing systems thinking
Data-driven
(evidence-based)
analysis—Emphasis on gathering
and using objective data on system
operation and system performance
Implementer involvement—Emphasis on involving the owners of all
components of the system in seeking a common understanding of its
delivery process
Multiple causation—Emphasis on
identifying the multiple root causes
of a set of system phenomena

8.

9.

10.

Solution identification—Emphasis
on seeking a set of solutions that
enhance overall system performance through simultaneous
improvements in a number of normally independent functions
Process optimization—Emphasis
on optimizing a delivery process
to meet customer needs regardless of existing precedents and on
implementing the system changes
regardless of existing territories
and fiefdoms
Continuing improvement—Emphasis on continuing the systems analysis even when a satisfactory solution
to the presenting problem is obtained
Organizational learning—Emphasis
on organizational learning so that
the capacity of the organization to
generate process improvement and
foster personal growth is enhanced

Structural Elements
Beyond the philosophical elements just cited,
a number of useful structural elements can be
used to structure, organize, and support the
continuous improvement process. Almost all
CQI initiatives make intensive use of these
structural elements, which reflect the operational aspects of CQI and include:
1.

2.

Process improvement teams—
Emphasis on forming and empowering teams of employees to deal
with existing problems and opportunities (see Chapter 6)
CQI tools—Use of one or more of
the CQI tools so frequently cited
in the industrial and health-quality
literature: flowcharts, checklists,
cause-and-effect diagrams, frequency and Pareto charts, run
charts, and control charts (see
Chapter 4)

Parallel organization—Development
of a separate management structure
to set priorities for and monitor CQI
strategy and implementation, usually
referred to as a quality council
Organizational leadership—Leadership, at the top levels and throughout the organization, to make the
process effective and foster its integration into the institutional fabric
of the organization (see Chapter 2)
Statistical thinking and analysis—
Use of statistics, including statistical process control, to identify
common vs. special causes of variation in processes and practices (see
Chapter 4)
Customer satisfaction measures—
Understanding the importance of
measuring customer satisfaction,
but also the strengths and weaknesses of available sources of data
and survey methodologies in current use (see Chapter 4)
Benchmarking—Use of benchmarking to identify best practices
in related and unrelated settings to
emulate as processes or use as performance targets
Redesign of processes from
scratch—Making sure that the end
product conforms to customer
requirements by using techniques
of quality function deployment
and/or process reengineering

Health Care–Specific Elements
The use of CQI in health care is often described
as a major management innovation, but it also
resonates with past and ongoing efforts within
the health services research community. The
health care quality movement has its own history, with its own leadership and values that
must be understood and respected. Thus, there
are a number of additional approaches and

9

techniques in health care that health managers and professionals have successfully added
to the philosophical and structural elements
associated with CQI, including:
1.

Epidemiological and clinical studies, coupled with insurance payment and medical records data,
often referred to as the basis of
evidence-based practice
Involvement of the medical staff
governance process, including
quality assurance, tissue committees, pharmacy and therapeutics
committees, and peer review
Use of risk-adjusted outcome
measures
Use of cost-effectiveness analysis
Use of quality assurance data
and techniques and risk management data

Evolution of the
Quality Movement

If you would understand anything, observe its
beginning and its development.
—Aristotle
To fully understand the foundation of the CQI
approaches that have developed over the years
and the reasons for their successful implementation, it is important to understand the
underlying philosophies of the founders of
this “movement” and the way in which these
methodologies that have been adapted to
health care evolved from industry. The application of quality-improvement techniques
has reached unprecedented levels throughout
the world and especially in health care. What
started as a “business solution” to address
major weaknesses, including a reputation for
poor quality, that Japan faced in its manufacturing after World War II has spread beyond

10

Chapter 1 The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement

manufacturing to encompass both products
and services. This proliferation includes multiple industries across the world and, most
notably, all sectors of health care. W. Edwards
Deming described what happened in Japan as
a “miracle that started off with a concussion
in 1950.” This miracle was the beginning of
an evolutionary process whereby the Japanese
military was transformed after the war and
given a new goal: the reconstruction of Japan.
As a result, “Japanese quality and dependability turned upward in 1950 and by 1954 had
captured markets the world over” (Deming,
1986, p. 486). Built upon the expertise of
Japanese leaders from industry, science, and
the military, and with the guidance of Deming,
using his own ideas and those of his colleague,
Walter Shewhart, this miracle would transform industry not only in Japan, but also in
many other countries around the world.
Although Deming and Shewhart both
had been advocating a statistical approach to
quality for some time, the Japanese were the
first to implement these ideas widely. In Japan,
the use of these techniques quickly spread to
both product and service organizations. Outside Japan, despite slow adoption at first, this
movement spread to the United States and
Europe in the 1960s and 1970s. But its largescale adoption did not occur until the 1980s
in manufacturing, most notably due to competition from the Japanese automobile industry. In fact, the U.S. industry was perceived
to be in a state of crisis when these methods
began to receive wider acceptance. As Deming
surmised, this crisis was due to poor quality
that could be traced primarily to the incorrect belief that quality and productivity were
incompatible. Deming demonstrated the fallacy of this notion in his landmark book, Out
of the Crisis, first published in 1982 (Deming,
1986), thus forming the basis of what is now
known as continuous quality improvement.
From this foundation, CQI has evolved
exponentially—over time, across the world,
and from industrial manufacturing to the provision of services. The beginning of the quality

revolution occurred in America in 1980, when
Deming was featured on an NBC television
documentary, “If Japan Can, Why Can’t We?”
and a later PBS program, “Quality or Else,”
both of which had a major impact on bringing
quality issues into the U.S. public’s awareness
(AmStat News, 1993).
Over many years, Deming made enormous
contributions to the development of CQI, but
he is perhaps best known for the 14-point program of recommendations that he devised for
management to improve quality (see BOX 1.1).
His focus was always on processes (rather
than organizational structures), on the evercontinuous cycle of improvement, and on the
rigorous statistical analysis of objective data.
Deming believed that management has the
final responsibility for quality because employees work in the system and management deals
with the system itself. He also felt that most
quality problems are management-controlled
rather than worker-controlled. These beliefs
were the basis for his requirement that CQI be
based on an organization-wide commitment,
including the important role and example of
senior leaders.
The quality evolution later crossed fields
as diverse as computer science, education,
and health care—and within health care, it
has evolved to encompass multiple levels and
segments of health care delivery. As discussed
earlier, this evolution has taken many forms
and names over the years, encompassing and
subsuming quality control, quality assurance,
quality management, and quality improvement. Like the field itself, its name has evolved
from total quality management (TQM) to continuous quality improvement (CQI), or simply
quality improvement (QI).

From TQM to CQI
The evolution from TQM to CQI was more
than a simple change in terminology; it represents a fundamental change in how organizations have come to recognize the importance
of ensuring that changes are improvements

and that the improvement processes are
ongoing, requiring learning and involvement
in the process at all levels, from the individual to the organization level. CQI has been
directly linked to management and leadership
competencies and philosophies that embrace
change and innovation as the keys to a vision
of value-driven growth. The fundamentals of
TQM are based on the scientific management
movement developed in the early 20th century.
Emphasis was given to “management based on
facts,” but with management assumed to be the
master of the facts. It was believed to be the
responsibility of management to specify one
correct method of work for all workers and
to see that personnel executed that method
to ensure quality. Gradually, that perspective
has been influenced by the human relations
perspective and by the recognition of the
importance and ability of the people in the
organization. FIGURE 1.1 illustrates the wide
range of leaders who were involved in the quality evolution, with an emphasis on health care.

Some of the most notable contemporaries of
Deming and Shewhart who were major contributors to the history of TQM, and later CQI,
include Armand Feigenbaum, Joseph Juran,
and Philip Crosby. Their contributions have
been widely documented in the literature, as
well as through organizations that continue to
promote their ideas, such as the Juran Institute.
They are included, along with many others,
in websites that profile these gurus of quality
improvement and their individual ideas and
techniques that form the basis of modern CQI.

Ongoing Evolution in Japan
While the quality concepts originally applied
in Japan were evolving across other countries,
they continued to develop and evolve within
Japan as well, with numerous original contributions to CQI thinking, tools, and techniques,
especially since the 1960s. The most famous of
the Japanese experts are Genichi Taguchi and
Kaoru Ishikawa.

Total participation is required of all members of an organization (quality must be
company-wide).
The next step of a process is its “customer,” just as the preceding step is its “supplier.”
Communicating with both customer and supplier is necessary (promoting feedback and
creating channels of communication throughout the system).
Emphasis is placed on participative teams, starting with “quality circles.”
Emphasis is placed on education and training.
Instituted the Deming Prize to recognize quality improvement.
Statistics are used rigorously.
Instituted “just in time” processes.

Taguchi was a Japanese quality expert
who emphasized using statistical techniques
developed for the design of experiments to
quickly identify problematic variations in a
service or product; he also advocated a focus
on what he called a “robust” (forgiving) design.
He emphasized evaluating quality from both
an end-user and a process approach. Ishikawa is well known for developing one of the
classic CQI tools, the fishbone (or Ishikawa)
cause-and-effect diagram (see Chapter 4).
Along with other Japanese quality engineers,
Ishikawa also refined the application of the
foundations of CQI and added the concepts
described in BOX 1.2.

Cross-Disciplinary Thinking
More than a historical business trend or a
movement, the growth of quality improvement
represents an evolution of both the philosophies and processes that have been studied
and improved over the years, through application, review, feedback, and then broader
application. There has been a fair amount
of scrutiny, and these approaches have not
only stood the test of time but have evolved
to address criticisms and have been adapted
to meet specialized needs that are unique
in some segments, especially in health care.
This phenomenon has occurred naturally as a
result of cross-disciplinary strategic thinking

processes, where learning occurs by focusing
not on what makes industries and disciplines
different from each other, but rather on what
they share in common (Brown, 1999). A good
example of this commonality is a focus on
adding value to products and services for customers, be they automobile buyers, airline passengers, or hospital patients. This notion can
be directly extended to quality improvement
(see FIGURE 1.2) by noting that industries—
for example, automobile manufacturing vs.
health care—may differ in terms of specific
mission, goals, and outcomes but may share
strategies to add value, including the philosophy, process, and tools of CQI. As a result, the
common strategic elements of CQI have been
adopted from diverse industrial applications
and then customized to meet the special needs
of health care.

Chapter 1 The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement

Comparing Industrial and
Health Care Quality
Cross-disciplinary learning between industry and health care was spurred during the
1990s and contributed to this evolutionary
process. A comparison of quality from an
industrial perspective vs. quality from a health
care perspective reveals that the two are surprisingly similar and that both have strengths
and weaknesses (Donabedian, 1993). The
industrial model is limited in that it (1) does
not address the complexities, including the
dynamic character and professional and cultural norms, of the patient–practitioner relationship; (2) downplays the knowledge, skills,
motivation, and legal/ethical obligations of the
practitioner; (3) treats quality as free, ignoring
quality–cost trade-offs; (4) gives more attention to supportive activities and less to clinical
ones; and (5) provides less emphasis on influencing professional performance via “education, retraining, supervision, encouragement,
and censure” (Donabedian, 1993, pp. 1–4). On
the other hand, Donabedian suggested that the
professional health care model can learn the
following from the industrial model:
1.

New appreciation of the fundamental soundness of health care
quality traditions
The need for even greater attention
to consumer requirements, values,
and expectations
The need for greater attention to
the design of systems and processes
as a means of quality assurance
The need to extend the selfmonitoring, self-governing tradition of physicians to others in the
organization
The need for a greater role by management in assuring the quality of
clinical care
The need to develop appropriate
applications of statistical control
methods to health care monitoring

7.

The need for greater education
and training in quality monitoring
and assurance for all concerned
(1993, pp. 1–4)

In reality, there is a continuum of CQI
activities, with manufacturing at one end of
the continuum and professional services at the
other (Hart, 1993). The CQI approach should
be modified in accordance with its position
along this continuum. Manufacturing processes have linear flows, repetitive cycle steps,
standardized inputs, high analyzability, and
low worker discretion. Professional services,
on the other hand, involve multiple nonstandardized and variable inputs, nonrepetitive
operations, unpredictable demand peaks, and
high worker discretion. Many organizations,
including health care organizations, have processes at different points along that continuum
that should be analyzed accordingly. The hospital, for example, has laboratory and support
operations that are like a factory and has preventive, diagnostic, and treatment activities
that are professional services. The objective
of factory-like operations is to drive out variability to conform to requirements and to
produce near-zero defects. At the other end,
the objectives of disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment are to do whatever it takes
to produce improved health and satisfaction and maintain the loyalty of customers—
including both patients (external customers)
and employees (internal customers).
An important contrast between traditional
industry and health care is evidence of the pace
of quality improvement initiatives in health
care relative to the traditional industries that
spawned CQI methods globally. As described
by a former director of the McKinsey Global
Institute, William Lewis, “For most industry
the benefits from the various quality movements have been quite large but … they are
also largely in the past” with only incremental
progress now being made, and he contrasts that
development with health care, which is the “big
exception” (Leonhardt, 2009, p. 11). So while

Evolution of the Quality Movement

health care has learned from manufacturing
and commercial industry, its evolution in CQI
has led to acceleration in comparison to the
slowdown, and even reversal, seen in manufacturing and commercial industry; for example, consider the quality issues faced in 2010
by Toyota—a manufacturing pioneer from
which some of these approaches have evolved
(Crawley, 2010; Dawson & Takahashi, 2011). (It
should be noted that reports in the commercial
media in recent years indicate that these issues
have been resolved by a return to best practices
and greater customer focus [Rechtin, 2014].)
This evolution, or cross-disciplinary
translation, continues within a variety of
health care settings, as will be illustrated
throughout this text, with some tools and
techniques being especially good examples of
cross disciplinary adoption. Probably the best
example is the Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA)
cycle originally developed by Shewhart (1931)
for industry. (Although the PDSA cycle is
often attributed to Deming, he attributes it
to Shewhart [Deming, 1986].) It is especially
amenable to widespread use in health care and
continues to find new applications to meet an
ever-widening range of clinical and programmatic problems (see FIGURE 1.3).
One very interesting example of the
cross-disciplinary/industry phenomenon, which
has been given much attention both in scientific journals and in popular media, is the

adoption of surgical checklists to prevent
errors. The checklist is a very simple but powerful project management and safety tool that
has been used in various industries, but it is
probably most well known for its effectiveness
in the airline industry. A strong case has been
made in scientific publications and in the popular media for greater adoption of checklists in
surgery (Haynes et al., 2009) and other medical specialties (Gawande, 2009; Pronovost
et al., 2006). Although its adoption in a wide
range of settings has been seen in recent years,
the effectiveness of this tool, used by itself, has
been questioned by some (Bosk et al., 2009) and
studied by many, with the goal of better understanding its role and improving its effectiveness (Avelling, McCulloch, & Dixon-Woods,
2013; de Vries et al., 2010; Wandersman et al.,
2016). The use of checklists also provides a
good illustration of some basic CQI principles
that have broader implications. For example,
checklist usage raises two key questions that
are important in regard to a variety of CQI
applications: (1) how much does the effectiveness of using checklists vary for different health
care applications and settings? and (2) what
is their specific role in improving health care
safety and quality? One brief answer to these
questions is that while the checklist is a simple tool, it is not a magic bullet—instead, it can
be an effective means for helping ensure the
application of other CQI principles in an overall

Chapter 1 The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement

program of quality assurance and improvement. For example, its use and effectiveness
(or lack thereof) has broad implications about
how health care teams communicate and
share responsibilities; how leadership supports innovations and change—ultimately a
cultural issue; and how to monitor and ensure
compliance with CQI initiatives (Avelling,
McCulloch, & Dixon-Woods, 2013; DixonWoods & Martin, 2016). Checklists provide
an example of the importance of teamwork in
CQI (see Chapter 6) and provide an example of
a CQI tool (in Chapter 4) as well as an example
of the broader issue of culture, leadership, and
diffusion of CQI in health care (in Chapter 2).
Checklists are also used as an example of the
use of social marketing to increase compliance
with CQI innovations and tools (in Chapter 8).
New approaches, refinements of older concepts, and different combinations of ideas are
occurring almost daily in this ongoing evolutionary process. As more and more organizations
adopt CQI, we are seeing increasing innovation
and experimentation with CQI thinking and its
applications. This is especially true of the health
care arena, where virtually every organization
has had to work hard to develop its own adaptation of CQI to the clinical process.

The Evolution Across Sectors of
Health Care
The evolution in health care—which started in
the most well-defined sector, hospitals—now
includes all segments of the health care system
and has become woven into the education of
future practitioners, including not only administrators and physicians but also nurses, public
health practitioners, and a wide array of other
health professionals. It has spanned health care
systems in many industrialized nations and
now has become a way of meeting emerging crises, with widespread global health applications
in resource-poor nations (see Chapter 13).
As illustrated in Figure 1.1, the health care
evolution of CQI may be traced back to the

work of Florence Nightingale, who pioneered
the use of statistical methods to analyze variation and propose areas for improvement. As
one of many quality improvement initiatives,
Florence Nightingale used descriptive statistics to demonstrate the link between unsanitary conditions and needless deaths during the
Crimean War (Cohen, 1984). The evolutionary context of quality in health care, described
in Figure 1.1, has occurred at many different
levels, spanning history and geography, and
has included a broadening of applications and
a sharpening of tools and techniques. Both
within and outside health care, probably the
most dramatic part of this evolution has been
the wide dispersion of knowledge about how
to use these techniques, first starting with a
small group of expert consultants and later
expanding to a broad range of practitioners
with a common goal to make improvements in
a diverse set of products and services. Coupled
with that “practice” goal have been educational
efforts to develop and disseminate qualityimprovement competencies by teaching these
methods to an ever-widening range of health
care professionals. For example, these efforts
have included recent initiatives in nursing, the
primary profession of Florence Nightingale
(Sherwood & Jones, 2013).
In parallel with this broadening health
care evolution over time and space, the same
improvement processes were being applied to
CQI tools and techniques, leading to improvements and greater precision relative to the
measurement of outcomes and processes. The
improvement processes also spawned international private- and public-sector organizations, which can be thought of as “health care
quality czars,” that have applied and expanded
these approaches. These organizations include
the Institute for Healthcare Improvement
(IHI) and both national and international
regulatory agencies, such as the CMS in the
United States, which, with the establishment of
Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs),
uses data from the Medicare and Medicaid
system to monitor quality of care and, more

importantly, to define improvement strategies
(Schenck, McArdle, & Weiser, 2013). Similarly,
local, national, and international accreditation
agencies, such as TJC in the United States and
its global counterparts (e.g., Joint Commission International [JCI]), have mandated the
need for quality improvement in large health
care systems (see Chapter 12). Ultimately, this
has led to the emergence of quality leaders,
with recognized achievements via a health
care organization’s eligibility to receive awards
such as the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (Hertz, Reimann, & Bostwick, 1994;
McLaughlin & Kaluzny, 2006).
Around the mid-1980s, CQI was applied
in several health care settings. Most notable
was the early work done by three physicians
following the principles outlined by Deming: Paul Batalden at Hospital Corporation of
America (HCA), Donald Berwick at Harvard
Community Health Center and IHI, and Brent
James at Intermountain Health Care. Examples of their work and ideas will be illustrated
throughout this chapter and this book.
Armed with the ideas of these creative
quality leaders who elaborated on techniques, such as the PDSA cycle that were
drawn originally from the pioneers of quality improvement, an acceleration marked by
more widespread applications has occurred
throughout all sectors of health care in the 21st
century. That acceleration was spurred greatly
by “a wake-up call” describing the crisis that
health care quality was facing entering the new
millennium.

The Big Bang—The
Quality Chasm

Quality under the rubric of patient safety suddenly came to dominate the scene following the
two significant IOM reports, To Err Is Human
(IOM, 2000) and Crossing the Quality Chasm
(IOM, 2001). Virtually all those concerns about
cost and benefits and professional autonomy

17

seemed swamped by the documentation of
unacceptably high rates of medical errors. The
recognition that needless human suffering,
loss of life, and wasted resources were related
to unnecessary variability in treatment and the
lack of implementation of known best practices
galvanized professional groups, regulators, and
payers into action. Suddenly, quality improvement was acknowledged to be a professional
responsibility, a quality-of-care issue rather
than a managerial tactic. Current investment
and involvement levels are high as evidence has
mounted that the variability in clinical processes
and the lack of conformance to evidence-based
best practices has cost the public dearly. Many of
the actors identified previously are demanding
accountability for patient safety and for achieving acceptable levels of clinical performance
and outcomes achievement. Adverse events are
now undergoing extreme scrutiny, and a broad
range of quality indicators are being reported,
followed, and compared by payers and regulators (see Chapter 10).
One important change that called even
greater attention to the seriousness of medical
errors was that, effective October 1, 2008, the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS) adopted a nonreimbursement policy
for certain “never events,” which are defined as
serious, preventable hospital-acquired conditions. The rationale is that hospitals cannot bill
CMS for adverse events and complications that
are considered never events because they are
preventable; the goal is to motivate hospitals
to accelerate improvement of patient safety. A
list of never events can be found at the Agency
for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)
website, and a summary of how this step came
about is offered by Michaels et al. (2007).
Local and regional variability in health
care has long been known to exist, but the
translation of that variability into missed
opportunities for improved outcomes has
been slow in coming. With that veil of secrecy
about medical errors lifted, the demands for
action and professional responsiveness have
become extensive. This sea-change goes well

18

Chapter 1 The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement

beyond concerns about malpractice insurance
to issues of clinical governance, professional
training, certification, and continuity of care.
For a while, financial questions seemed to
have dissipated as the social costs took precedence. However, these cost issues have certainly
been revisited and have grown in importance
with the full implementation of the ACA in
the United States and other health care reform
initiatives in other locations around the world.
Concerns about cost of care continue and need
to be considered relative to CQI initiatives and
the overall nature of the relationship of cost to
quality and the role of value.

From Industrialization
to Personalization

Quality has been and continues to be a central issue in health care organizations and
among health care providers. The classic
works of Avedis Donabedian, Robert Brook,
and Leonard Rosenfeld, to name a few, have
made major contributions to the definition,
measurement, and understanding of health
care quality. However, the corporatization of
health care in the United States (Starr, 1982)
and other changes to the health care system
have redefined, and will continue to redefine,
how we manage quality. Given the increasing
proportion of the gross national product allocated to health services and the redefinition
of health care as an “economic good,” health
care organizations are influenced to a growing
extent by organizations in the industrial sector. As part of this process, health care organizations have become “corporations,” with
expansion goals to create larger hospital systems. The long-held perception of health care
as a cottage industry persisted into the 1960s
and 1970s. In this view, health care was seen
as a craft or art delivered by individual professionals who had learned by apprenticeship and
who worked independently in a decentralized
system. These practitioners tailored their craft

to each individual situation using processes
that were neither recorded nor explicitly engineered, and they were personally accountable
for the performance and financial outcomes of
the care they provided.
The 1980s and 1990s witnessed a distinct
change, which is often described as the “industrialization of health care” (Kongstvedt, 1997).
This change affected almost all aspects of
health care delivery, influencing how risks are
allocated, how care is organized, and how professionals are motivated and incentivized. This
industrialization process can be described utilizing the dynamic stability model of Boynton,
Victor, and Pine (1993), which presents various
industrial transformation strategies. These can
be adapted to health care services to describe
the transformation from craft to a more industrialized approach. For example, one strategy
follows the traditional route of industrialization utilizing mass production to ensure high
levels of process stability, as illustrated by the
bundling of unique medical procedures into
a few high-volume, specialized centers. However, most health care activities have followed
an alternate route that is also described by this
model, bypassing mass production due to the
high variability in patient needs and using
techniques of CQI and process reengineering.
The Victor & Boynton (1998) model for
the organization suggests an appropriate path
for organizational development and improvement. As presented in FIGURE 1.4, health care
processes and product lines have begun to
move from the craft stage to positions in all of
the other three stages of that model. Each of the
four stages requires its own approach to quality.
1.

Craft requires that the individual
improve with experience and use
the tacit knowledge produced to
develop a better individual reputation and group reputation.
Craft activities can be leveraged
to a limited extent by a community of cooperating and teaching
crafts-persons.

Mass production requires the
discipline that produces conformance quality in high volume at
low cost. Critics sometimes refer
to this approach using terms such
as industrialization or the deskilling
of the profession and occasionally
mention Henry Ford’s assembly
lines as a negative model.
Process enhancement requires that
processes be analyzed and modified to develop a best-practice
approach using worker feedback
and process-owning teams within
the organization.
Mass customization requires that
the organization takes that best
practice, modularizes and supports
it independently, and then uses
those modules to build efficient,

low-cost processes that are responsive to individual customer wants
and needs.
Because health care is a complex, multiproduct environment, various types of
care can be found at each of the four stages,
depending on the state of the technology and
the strategy of the delivery unit. The correct
place to be along that pathway depends on the
current state of the technology. The revolution
in health care organization is driven not only
by economics, but also by the type of knowledge work that is being done. As described in
Victor & Boynton (1998, p. 129):
Managers take the wrong path when
they fail to account for the fact that
(1) learning is always taking place,
and (2) what learning is taking place

20

Chapter 1 The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement

depends on the kind of work one
is doing. The learning system we
describe along the right path requires
that managers leverage the learning from previous forms of work. …
If managers attempt to transform
without understanding the learning
taking place …, then transformation
efforts will be at best slightly off the
mark and at worst futile. In addition, if managers misunderstand
what type of work (craft, mass production, process enhancement, or
mass customization) is taking place
in a given process or activity when
transformation starts, then they may
use the wrong transformation steps
(development, linking, modularization, or renewal).
These authors, however, were referring
to a single, commercial firm with a relatively
limited line of goods and services. In health
care, a single organization such as a hospital
might contain examples of multiple stages due
to the variety of its products. There is a recognition that complexity is ever-increasing;

for example, one hears complaints that some
traditional definitions apply to patients with
only one diagnosis, whereas most very sick
patients, especially the elderly, have multiple
diagnoses. Therefore, the prevailing quality
and performance enhancement systems have
to be prepared with much greater levels of
variability—in patient problem constellations,
anatomy, physiology, and preferences, as well
as in provider potentials and preferences
(McLaughlin, 1996). Furthermore, increased
availability of genetic information will further
fractionate many disease categories, making
the definitions of disease even more complex.
Among other ideas, this has led to the concept of personalization of medicine and an
associated concept, individualization of care,
which will be discussed in greater detail in
the next section.
FIGURE 1.5 suggests how this has and will
occur in health care. As scientific information about a health care process accumulates,
it shifts from the craft stage to the process
enhancement stage. After the process is codified and developed further, it may shift into
the mass production mode if the approach is
sufficiently cut and dried, the volume is high,

and the patients will accept this impersonal
mode of delivery. If there is still too much art
or lack of science to justify codification, the
enhanced process can be returned to the craft
mode or moved into the mass customization
and co-configuration pathway.
The craft mode contains multiple delivery
alternatives. For example, if someone were to
decide to commission an artist to make a custom work of art, that person has two ways to
specify how it is to be controlled. The first is
to say, “You are the artist. Do your thing, and
I will pay whatever it costs.” This is fee-forservice indemnity. The other is to say, “You
can decide what to do, but here is all that I can
afford to pay.” This is capitation. In both cases,
the grand design and the execution are still
in the hands of the artist. However, that does
not preclude the artist from learning by doing,
obtaining suggestions from vendors of materials and equipment, or observing and collaborating with colleagues. Neither the artist nor
the person commissioning the art commits to
a single “best” way to do things, because neither is able to articulate or agree on the best
way to reach the desired outcome.
The mass-customization pathway has long
been thought of as the best way to produce satisfied health care customers at low or reasonable relative costs. The organization develops
a series of modular approaches to prevention
and treatment, highly articulated and well
supported by information technology, so that
they can be deployed efficiently in a variety of
places and configurations to respond to customer needs. Clinical pathways represent one
example of modularization. They represent best
practices as known to the organization, and
they are applied and configured by a configuror (the health care professional) to meet the
needs of the individual patient. This requires
an integrated information system that will give
the health care professional, usually a generalist, access to specialized information and to full
information about the patient’s background,
medical history, and status; the system will

21

also allow the health care professional to synchronize the implementation of the modules of
service being delivered. In a sense, mass customization represents a process that simulates
craft but is highly science based, coordinated,
integrated with other process flows, and efficient. How does this differ from the well-run
modern hospital or clinic? As described by
Victor & Boynton (1998, pp. 12–13):
The tightly linked process steps developed under process enhancement are
now exploded, not into isolated parts,
but into a dynamic web of interconnected modular units. Rather than the
sequential assembly lines, … work is
now organized as a complex, reconfigurable product and service system.
Modularization breaks up the
work into units that are interchangeable on demand from the customer.
And everything has to happen fast. …
Modularization transforms work by
creating a dynamic, robust network
of units.
Within some of these units, …
there may still be active craft, mass
production, or process enhancement
work taking place, but all the possible interfaces among modules must
be carefully designed so that they can
rapidly, efficiently, and seamlessly
regroup to meet customer needs.
Where does science come in? Victor and
Boynton refer to architectural knowledge, a
much deeper process understanding than that
needed for earlier stages of their model. Also at
a practical level, it takes hard science to legitimize the conformance by providers required
to make such a system work.
The remaining stage of this model has
been called “co-configuration”—a system in
which the customer is linked into the network,
and customer intelligence is accessed as readily
as the providers’ knowledge. In a futuristic sense,

22

Chapter 1 The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement

one should also be able to include the patient in
the decision-making network to a high degree.
The future has arrived in the form of what many
authors call “mass personalization.” It represents
an even more intense involvement of customers in product and service delivery choices; in
health care, patient-specific needs and wants
are being more directly addressed.

Mass Personalization
Personalization is an evolutionary concept
that is not only having an impact on how
industries deliver products and services but
also on how organizations are structured, such
as in learning organizations. It is an example
of a business application that continues to
evolve within the business world and is now
beginning to evolve at its own pace within
health care. In business, this evolution is especially apparent in service industries, where the
morphing of mass customization into mass
personalization has been fueled by the rapid
growth of technology, especially the Internet,
search engines, and personal media, to bring
each customer’s wants and needs in direct contact with service providers.
This phase of evolution has happened
quite rapidly, and its speed of growth is directly
correlated with technological advances. “Two
decades after its conception there is growing
evidence that mass customization strategy
is transforming into a mass personalization
strategy” (Kumar, 2007, p. 533). It was not until
1987 that the term mass customization was first
introduced; however, from 1987 to 2008, more
than 1,100 articles on mass customization
appeared in scholarly journals, with exponential growth in the 1990s (Kumar, 2007).
Personalization of products began in the
1950s, with affordability being the key component that led to its popularity and growth.
As computer technologies have become more
personalized, the concepts of mass customization and co-configuration have evolved into
personalization, at an accelerated pace. As

Kumar explains, “Mass personalization strategy evolved from mass customization strategy as a result of strides in information and
operational technologies” (2007, p. 536). Both
strategies are in current use; while similar, they
do have differences. As described by Tseng &
Piller (2003, p. 7), who have written extensively on this trend:
Personalization must not be mixed up
with customization. While customization relates to changing, assembling,
or modifying product or service
components according to customers’ needs and desires, personalization involves intense communication
and interaction between two parties,
namely customer and supplier. Personalization in general is about selecting or filtering information objects for
an individual by using information
about that individual (the customer
profile) and then negotiating the
selection with the individual. … From
a technical point of view, automatic
personalization or recommendation
means matching meta-information
of products or information objects
against meta-information of customers (stored in the customer profile).
This leads to strategies that are directed at
what Kumar calls “a market of one” (Kumar,
2007, p. 533).

Health Care Applications of
Personalization
That mass personalization is directly applicable to CQI is quite obvious due to their common focus on adding value and customer
satisfaction and their common reliance on
data and technology. What is a bit surprising
is that personalization can be applied directly
to CQI in health care, and how rapidly this

From Industrialization to Personalization

stage of evolution from business to health care
is occurring. This concept is closely related
to what Berwick calls “patient-centeredness,”
a consumerist view of quality of care, which
he describes as involving “disruptive shifts in
control and power out of the hands of those
who give care and into the hands of those who
receive it” (Berwick, 2009, p. 555).
At first glance, the importance and reliance on evidence-based practice as part of
CQI in health care might seem contradictory to personalization; however, as noted by
Sackett and many others, the steps in applying
evidence-based practice include evaluating the
best data available but also using individual
clinical judgment and patient input, including patient preferences, in making final treatment decisions (Sackett, 1996; Satterfield et al.,
2009). The current definition of health care
personalization encompasses the concepts
of individualized care and shared decision
making, in addition to personalized medicine
(Barratt, 2008; Pfaff et al., 2010; Robinson,
Callister, Berry, & Dearing, 2008). In all forms,
these concepts lead to greater focus on patient
characteristics, needs, and preferences in decision making about their care, and they are all
closely associated with the customer focus
concepts that are central to CQI. With greater
availability of information, via the Internet
and other more traditional sources, patients
and their families are playing a greater role
in health care decision making and quality of
care. Sources of data and information abound
in numerous easily accessible formats. For
example, for many years the AHRQ has provided information to encourage patient participation in their medical care and the quality
of the medical care they receive; one example
is the AHRQ website “Questions to Ask Your
Doctor” (AHRQ, 2012). Similar resources
have long been provided by other organizations to support patients with specialty needs;
for example, the National Cancer Institute’s
Cancer Information Service was established in
1975 to help cancer patients find information

23

and treatment resources (NCI n.d.). What
has contributed notably to the use of such
information is that patients now have greater
knowledge and access to technology, such as
search engines to find medical information.
This has led to input by patients and their families in their own health care decisions and in
the quality of their care, which is discussed in
greater detail in Chapter 7.
But the growth in health care personalization goes beyond patients having access to
medical information; it relates directly to medical strategies and emerging science for providing higher quality, safer, more personalized
treatments. This trend draws strength from
a vision of personalized medicine primarily
in terms of genomic medicine; it is a means
of “focusing on the best ways to develop new
therapies and optimize prescribing by steering
patients to the right drug at the right dose at the
right time” (Hamburg & Collins, 2010, p. 301).
This vision includes partnerships among
industry, academia, doctors, patients, and the
public that will lead to a “national highway for
personalized medicine.” One of the earliest
signs of success relates to identifying the optimal dosage and combination of treatments for
cancer patients (Spector & Blackwell, 2009).
As in the business community, the personalization concept in health care has evolved
to include broader components of health care,
in part because of advances in research and
technology. In medical care, this includes
recent breakthroughs in genomics (Spector
& Blackwell, 2009) but also tools provided by
computer technology, including greater use
of electronic medical records. Individualized
treatment strategies are further extensions
of these concepts, going beyond genomics to
include patients’ preferences and experiences
in shared decision making with their providers, allowing greater patient participation
in choice of drugs and dosages and administration; even more broadly, individualization leads to patients being more proactive
in regard to prevention, screening, and early

24

Chapter 1 The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement

treatment, through greater use of information
technology, electronic medical records, and
decision-making tools, such as patient decision support technologies (Pfaff et al., 2010).
Health care personalization can be thought
of more broadly as an extension of Wagner’s
(1996) chronic care model, which focuses on
the individual rather than the condition. This
approach is especially useful when individuals
have multiple chronic conditions.
The evolutionary path of CQI within
health care is an important catalyst to personalization that is reflective of broader societal
trends spanning a wide range of businesses.
These trends are reflected in the concept of
customer relationship management (CRM).
As described by Kumar (2007), “CRM is the
philosophy, policy, and coordinating strategy connecting different players within an
organization so as to coordinate their efforts
in creating an overall valuable series of experiences, products, and services for the customer.” Kumar notes that CRM also requires
that the customer be integrated into all aspects
of product and process design and that “customer driven innovation has become a key
source of strategic advantage.” This relates not
only to health care personalization but also to
the traditional focus on customers in CQI and
on methods of gathering customer feedback.
This is reflected in many ways including the
greater use (and some abuse) of patient satisfaction surveys as a way of evaluating quality
of care (see Chapter 4).
With new opportunities come new challenges. The greater amount of information
available and the increased role of “untrained”
patients and their families in care decisions
present the challenge of knowing how to evaluate the quality and appropriateness of treatment options. This has led to some level of
conflict as the two extremes of standardization
vs. personalization strain the boundaries and
definitions of evidence-based medicine, with
both extremes striving to achieve the highest quality of care. There is an ongoing broad
discussion throughout health care, locally

and globally, about how to balance these
concepts (Pfaff et al., 2010; Robinson et al.,
2008; Satterfield et al., 2009; Wandersman
et al., 2016). What is clear is that these patientcentered concepts are here to stay and will lead
to the next stages of the evolution in health
care and, as with the previous stages, will continue to grow exponentially.
Likewise, referring back to Berwick’s
(2009) notion of “patient-centeredness,”
patients are playing—and should play—a
greater role in health care quality improvement. These patient-centered trends have
had an impact on quality improvement
education for health care professionals. For
example, they are being incorporated into
nursing education (Sherwood & Jones, 2013).
Day and Smith (2007, pp. 139–140) describe
this need:
Unfortunately there is wide variation
in the quality of information provided
by websites and no search engine
screens for quality or accuracy. An
important part of basic nursing education is helping students develop
skills that enable them to evaluate
web-based information, especially if
that information is going to be passed
on to a patient or family member or
used as the basis for patient and family teaching.
Thus, as with other evolutionary stages in
CQI, new challenges to quality management
present themselves and will hopefully lead
to new opportunities in an unending cycle of
improvement.

The Scientific Method
of CQI

As CQI philosophies and processes have
evolved within health care, a series of broadbased approaches have evolved and proven to
be widely applicable across a range of health

The Scientific Method of CQI

care settings. These can be thought of as
umbrella approaches under which specific
change methods can be applied. At the foundation of these is the scientific method and
the historically proven PDSA cycle, which
has been particularly successful in health
care as frameworks within which a variety
of improvement methods have been applied
to measure and further initiate improvement
strategies.
Walter Shewhart at Bell Laboratories, was
the first to introduce the Plan, Do, Study, Act
(PDSA) cycle, which was presented earlier in
Figure 1.3. It should also be noted that over
time, the abbreviation PDSA was changed
by some to PDCA, the “S” for study being
changed to “C” for check, as in checking what
impact an improvement has made on the process being changed. Today the terms are used
interchangeably, as we will do throughout
this book. Either way, Shewhart’s concept has
become a very powerful and frequently used
quality improvement methodology that has
withstood the test of time.
Stated quite simply, PDSA cycles “provide
a structure for iterative testing of changes to
improve quality of systems. … The pragmatic
principles of PDSA cycles promote the use of
a small scale iterative approach to test interventions, as this enables rapid assessment and
provides flexibility to adapt the change according to feedback to ensure fit-for-purpose
solutions are developed” (Taylor et al., 2014,
pp. 290–291). The key features of any PDSA
application are:

Use of data over time (to understand the impact of change)
Documentation (to support local
learning and transferability to other
settings) (Taylor et al., 2014, p. 293)

25

The two very successful and well-known
applications of the PDCA/PDSA cycle that
have evolved in health care are HCA’s FOCUS–
PDCA model (Batalden & Stoltz, 1993) and
the Model for Improvement (Langley et al.,
2009). These encompass two frameworks that
have been developed to use in conjunction
with PDCA/PDSA cycles. In addition to these
two major PDSA applications, numerous other
CQI initiatives have centered around this basic
improvement cycle.
The broad applicability of the PDSA cycle
in health care can be traced directly to its roots
as it was applied by Deming. One of Deming’s
(1993) major premises was that management
needs to undergo a transformation. In order
to respond successfully to challenges to organizations and their environments, the way to
accomplish that transformation, which must
be deliberately learned and incorporated into
management, is by pursuing what he called
“profound knowledge.” The key elements
of his system of profound knowledge are
(1) appreciation for a system, (2) knowledge
about variation, (3) theory of knowledge, and
(4) psychology.
The Deming process is especially useful
in health care because professionals already
have knowledge of the subject matter as well
as a set of values and disciplines that fit the
Deming philosophy. Training in Deming
methods adds knowledge of how to build
a new theory using insights about systems,
variation, and psychology, and it focuses on
the answers given to the set of basic questions that center around knowing what is to
be accomplished. Furthermore, it applies
a cyclical process of testing and learning
from data whether the change being made
is an improvement and what improvements
are needed in the future (Batalden & Stoltz,
1993). A Deming approach, as adopted by the
HCA in Nashville, Tennessee, is illustrated in
FIGURE 1.6. It was referred to by the HCA as
FOCUS–PDCA and provided the firm’s health
care workers with a common language and an
orderly sequence for implementing the cycle

The Scientific Method of CQI

In parallel with the FOCUS–PDCA model
was the introduction in 1992 of the Model for
Improvement by Langley et al. (2009). It includes
a PDSA cycle as its core approach, returning to
the traditional “S,” emphasizing the importance
of studying what has been accomplished before
making further changes (FIGURE 1.7). Careful
study and reflection are points of emphasis made
by Berwick (1996), who describes this model as
“inductive learning—the growth of knowledge
through making changes and then reflecting on
the consequences of those changes.”
Central to the Model for Improvement are
three key questions:
1.
2.
3.

What are we trying to accomplish?
How will we know that a change is
an improvement?
What change can we make that will
result in an improvement?

What are we trying to
accomplish?

How will we know
that a change is an

What changes can we
make that will result

The wide use of these approaches is due
directly to the elegance and simplicity of the
PDSA cycle. Likewise, the range of applications
ties directly to the generalizability of the PDSA
cycle. Recent applications have included public
health (see Chapter 11), health care in resourcepoor countries (see Chapter 13) and traditional
medical care in industrialized settings, which
are described throughout this book.
However, with the widespread use of
PDSA, there have been some questions raised
about how to assess validity and generalizability of specific applications before their
results are transferred into clinical practice as
new evidence-based methods (Speroff, James,
Nelson, Headrick, & Brommels, 2004). These
questions fall under the broad heading of how
to apply critical appraisal criteria to PDSA, and
other CQI initiatives, in a manner that is similar to appraisal of clinical research studies that
are directed at efficacy and safety of new treatments or drugs. One approach to addressing
these questions is to carefully review how well
the key features of the PDSA methods (listed
above) have been applied in a specific application; this approach is outlined by Taylor et al.
(2014). Included in this approach is Berwick’s
emphasis on careful study of findings at the “S”
stage of each cycle, before acting on those findings (Berwick, 1996).
A useful set of guidelines for strengthening PDSA applications as well as other CQI
initiatives, and which parallel the recommendations of Taylor et al. (2014), are presented by
Speroff et al. (2004, p. 36) and start with four
core questions:

four questions, including how to improve the
causal inferences (internal validity) and generalizability (exernal validity) of PDSA studies
(Speroff et al., 2004). Because of the simplicity
and consequently the broad usage of PDSA,
careful attention should be paid to the guidelines described above in order to ensure proper
use and both internal and external validity of
applications of the PDSA methodology.
Similar discussions have also been carried
out recently in regard to improving the applicability of other well known CQI methods and
specific results. Recommendations have been
presented for greater emphasis on the fidelity
of the applications and fuller understanstanding, and consideration of the context, in which
project-specific results are obtained before
broadly assuming the robustness of their findings. These recommendations help to explain
why some CQI methods are not achieving the
results that are expected and should be carried out before generalizing them to other settings, and we should always be cautious to not
assume that a “magic bullet” has been found
that will produce improvements in any situation, regardless of context (Dixon-Woods &
Martin, 2016).

Conclusions

The examples of how CQI has evolved in
an exponential manner, especially since the
advent of the new millennium, are many and
varied. Whether this trend is due to greater
customer awareness and demands, technology
improvements, greater competition, or a combination of these factors, what is clear is that
the trend is continuing on a global scale. While
some traditional industries that had incorporated CQI are now “making only incremental
progress” (Leonhardt, 2009) CQI in health care
is leaping forward, using examples and lessons
from outside as well as inside health care.
National developments (e.g., the ACA in the
United States) and international developments
(e.g., applications of CQI in resource-poor

nations) have been both the result of and the
source of global learning. This cycle of learning has led to innovations and paradigm shifts
that will ensure further evolution in the future.
The institutionalization of CQI in public
health, which represents an extension of what
has been learned in medical and hospital care,
continues to grow due to various influences
that mirror other health care sectors, such as
national and local accreditation efforts.
The examples in this text of how CQI has
spread and evolved are by no means exhaustive; improvements will continue to evolve at
a pace that is difficult to capture in any snapshot in time. But the patterns of change that
are described in this text provide a strong basis
for future health improvement models and the
challenges that come with these future models, as they address the questions of quality
and cost and the issues of “value-added” care,
leading to further learning and innovation to
meet customer needs and improved health
outcomes across the globe.

CHAPTER 2

Factors Influencing the
Application and Diffusion of
CQI in Health Care
William A. Sollecito and Julie K. Johnson
Change is not merely necessary to life — it is life.
—Alvin Toffler (Futurist)

C

ontinuous quality improvement (CQI)
has gained acceptance within all sectors
of health care and across geographic
and economic boundaries. It has evolved as a
global strategy for improving health care in a
variety of settings, spanning a broad number
of issues and improving services to a variety of
customers ranging from individual patients to
communities. The range of applications covers
not only direct patient care in primary care
or hospital settings, but also disease prevention and population initiatives—such as HIV,
childhood obesity, and influenza vaccination
programs—under the domain of public health
agencies at the local, national, and international levels. These applications are characterized by continuous, ongoing learning and
sharing among disciplines about ways to use
CQI philosophies, processes, and tools in a
variety of settings. New applications continue
32

to emerge, but at the same time, there are new
challenges to the broad application of CQI.
In this chapter, we examine the factors and
processes that facilitate or impede the implementation of CQI as a dynamic programmatic
innovation within a health care setting.
While many of the barriers to more rapid
adoption of CQI in health care were reduced
during the first decade of the 21st century,
we continued to face many challenges to the
widespread adoption of CQI. Some of these
challenges were due to the scientific method—
for example, the definition of evidence-based
practice and how it varied across different
areas of health care, with medicine perhaps
being the most rigid due to an over-emphasis
on randomized, controlled trials. Satterfield
et al. (2009) reviewed this issue, noting that
the interdisciplinary nature of health care
research requires a new broader definition of
evidence-based practice. This broader model
represents a transformation in thinking that
might increase the flexibility and the range of
methodologies that are used to make scientific

The Current State of CQI in Health Care

decisions, for example through the greater
use of quasi-experimentation, and one effect
of this model’s adoption might be an increase
in CQI initiatives. Other transformations that
have occurred include the greater emphasis on
translational research and the introduction of
implementation research (see Chapter 3).
Since 2010, progress in CQI has been
made at the system level in the United States,
as a direct consequence of national initiatives
including, but not limited to, the Affordable
Care Act (ACA), which includes incentives that
could serve as a catalyst for innovation such as
those directed at lowering hospital acquired
infections; and the implementation of new care
models such as “primary medical care homes”
(Somander, 2015). Also since 2011, the National
Quality Strategy has been in place in the United
States; this initiative, led by the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is
a transdisciplinary strategy to improve quality
of care (AHRQ, 2017). Another major factor
influencing system-wide CQI implementation,
especially in public health, has been accreditation initiatives (see Chapters 11 and 12). Also
noteworthy on a global scale has been progress made to expand CQI at a greater pace in
resource-poor countries (see Chapter 13).
While progress has been made in understanding and implementing CQI, new challenges have arisen, and old challenges persist.
For example, despite incentives for prevention, significant challenges remain in reducing
medical errors; these are addressed further in
Chapters 9 and 10. And some of the advances
in technology, which are intended, at least in
part, to facilitate greater adoption of CQI at
the system level, have had a negative effect on
individual health care providers’ motivation to
implement CQI. These include the more widespread use of electronic health records and
electronic patient satisfaction surveys; these
are discussed further later in this chapter as
well as in Chapter 4. As a result, some important questions remain about the adaptation and
diffusion of quality improvement methods,

33

especially in regard to the central role of individual health care providers. These include
questions such as:
■
■
■

Why aren’t more health care providers using
CQI tools and processes?
Why is the gap between knowledge and
practice so large?
Why don’t clinical systems incorporate
the findings of clinical science or copy the
“best known” practices reliably, quickly,
and even gratefully into their daily work
simply as a matter of course?

The answers to these questions, which
have been raised by CQI leaders such as
Dr. Brent James (Leonhardt, 2009) and
Dr. Donald Berwick (2003), are multifaceted.
Central to this issue is the question of how to
influence practitioners to adopt new ideas and
the broader topic of diffusion of innovation in
health care.
The remainder of this chapter will address
several questions:

What is the current state of quality in
health care, and what are the problems
regarding implementation of CQI in
health care?
Given the widespread application of CQI
in recent years, what are the factors that
contribute to the implementation of CQI
across industries and settings?
Specifically for our application in health
care, what are the factors that have influenced the rate of diffusion and spread of
CQI in health care?
What steps are needed to develop a culture in health care where CQI is the norm?

34

Chapter 2 Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care

To Err Is Human (IOM, 2000) and Crossing the
Quality Chasm (IOM, 2001). Although there is
evidence that there are global trends leading
to ongoing improvements in health care, an
earlier assessment of the state of health in the
United States (Swensen et al., 2010, p. e12[1])
still persists today:
U.S. health care is broken. Although
other industries have transformed
themselves using tools such as standardization of value-generating processes, performance measurement,
and transparent reporting of quality, the application of these tools to
health care is controversial, evoking
fears of “cookbook medicine,” loss
of professional autonomy, a misinformed focus on the wrong care, or
a loss of individual attention and the
personal touch in care delivery. …
Our current health care system is
essentially a cottage industry of nonintegrated, dedicated artisans who
eschew standardization. … Growing
evidence highlights the dangers of
continuing to operate in a cottageindustry mode. Fragmentation of care
has led to suboptimal performance.
These statements were made at a time
when the United States was launching the most
major health reform in its history, the ACA,
amid great opposition—opposition that still
continues today. The challenge of the coming
years continues to be how to build on the gains
that we have made in the past and how to fix
what many still consider a broken system.
Rather than assume that we have any easy
answers—which we do not—some time will
be devoted in this chapter to examples of successes, with a particular focus on CQI philosophies and processes, as models of how to
generalize these successes more widely. Hopefully this will give us some direction toward a
set of ideas to expand the implementation of
CQI across a broader range of providers.

Dr. Brent James, former Executive Director of the Institute for Health Care Delivery Research and Vice President of Medical
Research and Continuing Medical Education
at Intermountain Health Care, in an interview
with the New York Times, gave several examples of how Intermountain Health Care led the
way to value-based care through the use of CQI
processes. He identified the lack of widespread
change as being directly related to the complexity of the health care system; a clear symptom of the depth of problems that persist is that
the American health care system is vastly more
expensive, but not vastly better, than the health
systems of other countries (Leonhardt, 2009).
Intermountain Health Care has also led the
way to the future by implementing innovations
that are rooted in past philosophies and processes of CQI, most notably Deming’s process
management theories. In a 2011 report, they
demonstrated the basic CQI principle that the
most effective way to reduce health care costs
is to increase quality, using methodologies that
are sustainable and generalizable to the entire
nation, and which could facilitate the greater
and more effective implementation of the ACA
(James & Savitz, 2011). (Further details and
ideas for academic discussion of the process
for achieving success at Intermountain Health
Care can be found in a case study describing
the “Intermountain Way to Positively Impact
Costs and Quality” [Savitz, 2012].)
Dr. Donald Berwick founded the Institute
for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) more than
25 years ago and has also served as Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS). In 2003, he noted “Americans
spend almost 40% more per capita for health
care than any other country, yet rank 27th in
infant mortality, 27th in life expectancy, and are
less satisfied with their care than the English,
Canadians, or Germans” (Berwick 2003, p. 69).
Two of the important issues at the heart of this
problem, complexity and cost, were also key
factors in the debate about health reform in the
United States in 2009; they are also contributors to the explanation of why CQI has not been

CQI and the Science of Innovation

more widely adopted. He also addressed the
issues of complexity and cost is his introduction
of the Triple Aim of health care, to be discussed
in greater detail later in this chapter (Berwick,
Nolan, & Whittington, 2008).
The complexity of the health care system is
both a challenge and a source of ideas for how
to make improvements (Plsek & Greenhalgh,
2001). Health care can be described as a complex adaptive system, a concept that has implications for how to improve the system. For
example, the importance of leadership is critical, as are incentives for improvement. As a
complex adaptive system, health care can only
be designed to a certain extent and cannot
be designed around minimizing costs; rather,
the focus must be on maximizing value (Rouse,
2008; Spath & Kelly, 2017).

CQI and the Science of
Innovation

While health care is unique in many ways,
one commonality that it has with other complex endeavors is the difficulty surrounding
diffusion of innovation, starting with simple
resistance to change but including many other
complex factors. Understanding these issues
helps to provide pathways toward greater diffusion of CQI in health care. The research and
principles that are specific to diffusion of innovation of health services are summarized in a
systematic review of the literature presented by
Greenhalgh et al. (2005). From this review, it
is noted that there is a wide range of literature
using a variety of concepts and approaches
that describe how to move along the spectrum
from the initiation of a concept for change to
the spread, diffusion, and institutionalization
of innovation.
Diffusion theory is useful in understanding
the factors that thwart or support the adoption
of CQI in health care. Because of the complexity of health care and the added complexity of
CQI, as alluded to earlier in this chapter, there

35

are no simple answers about how to move CQI
innovations into the mainstream of health care
more quickly and efficiently. Complexity must
be considered in understanding innovation.
Although there are competing theories about
how and why, innovation clearly does happen
in “complex zones.” There is some evidence
that while innovation may not be susceptible to being managed, it is possible to design
and control organizational conditions that
“enhance the possibility of innovation occurring and spreading” (Greenhalgh, Robert,
Bate, Macfarlane, & Kyriakidou, 2005, p. 80).
Addressing this complexity requires, first and
foremost, leadership, but also the creation of
a receptive and even enthusiastic culture; one
excellent example of how this has been accomplished in CQI in health care is the formation
of quality improvement collaboratives, such
as the SURPASS collaborative group, which
among many accomplishments includes the
successful application of surgical checklists to
improve patient safety (de Vries et al., 2010).
The speed and overall adoption of any
change, including CQI, can be influenced by
the characteristics of the change and how it
is perceived by those responsible for implementation. These characteristics include
relative advantage, compatibility, simplicity,
trialability, and observability (Rogers, 1995).
All of these characteristics relate to changes
and improvements in health care, and two are
particularly relevant to health care: compatibility, which relates to how closely the change
ideas align with the existing culture and environment, and trialability, which addresses
how the changes can be adapted and tested
in the new environments in which they are
being spread.
A further extension of these change
concepts yields the following seven rules for
dissemination of innovation in health care
(Berwick, 2003):

3.

Find sound innovations.
Find and support innovators.
Invest in early adopters.

4.
5.
6.
7.

Make early-adopter activity
observable.
Trust and enable reinvention.
Create slack for change.
Lead by example.

All of these rules are applicable to innovations around CQI; leadership, trust, and reinvention are fundamental. Reinvention has to
do with the cross-disciplinary learning concept
that has permeated CQI and is responsible for
its evolution across industries and across the
globe. CQI cannot be a top-down mandate. It
must be part of the vision of an organization
and accepted by all who must implement CQI,
thus requiring trust at all levels, which comes
from leadership, teamwork, and Deming’s concept of “constancy of purpose.” Top leadership
must be involved, supporting and communicating the vision for innovation and change;
however, participation, buy-in, and support
from opinion leaders at all levels within an
organization are critical for successful implementation and the process of reinvention.
One size will not fit all. As described by
Berwick, “To work, changes must be not only
adopted locally, but also locally adapted”
(2003, p. 1974). Berwick asserts that for this
to happen, there must be reinvention. In his
words, “Reinvention is a form of learning,
and, in its own way, it is an act of both creativity and courage. Leaders who want to foster
innovation … should showcase and celebrate
individuals who take ideas from elsewhere and
adapt them to make them their own” (Berwick,
2003, p. 1974).
The checklist tool cited in Chapters 1 and 8
of this book is a clear illustration of this process
of reinvention and leadership. It was adapted
from the airline and other industries, first to
intensive care and later to surgery, with trusted
leaders in their fields and disseminating their
ideas and successes via scientific venues. The
fact that these evidence-based tools are not fully
accepted and used returns us to the point that
health care is complex and requires diligence to

spread the improvement process. The systematic review of diffusion of innovation in health
services identifies complexity as one of the
key elements that is inversely associated with
successful diffusion. Quite often, due to the
complex nature of health care systems, equally
complex quality improvement strategies are
required, thus lessening their quick and easy
adoption. This helps to explain why simpler
quality improvement processes, such as the use
of PDSA cycles, have enjoyed broad success.
But other factors may need to be considered to
overcome resistance to changes in health care
procedures and understand how these changes
truly lead to improvements (Langley et al.,
2009). For example, a prospective study of the
attributes of 42 clinical practice recommendations in gynecology (Foy et al., 2002) helps to
explain what these factors may be. After review
of almost 5,000 patient records, findings indicate two relevant outcomes that explain why
there may be unexpected resistance to change.
First, recommendations that were compatible with clinician values and did not require
changes to fixed routines were associated with
greater compliance. Second, initial noncompliance could be reversed after audit and feedback
stages were carried out, indicating that perhaps
more time will yield greater compliance. This
is especially to be considered when evaluating
improvements in outcomes (vs. processes),
which may require more time and repeated
cycles of process changes to take hold and be
sustained.
The techniques and philosophies described
throughout this book provide some other
examples of progress that has been made in specific segments of health care and also describe
models that can be considered to increase diffusion of CQI ideas. For example, social marketing has been documented as being an effective
tool for understanding ways to improve the
impact of innovations in health care in general
(Greenhalgh et al., 2005). In Chapter 8 of this
text and in an illustrative case study (Breland,
2012), a novel social marketing approach is

The Business Case for CQI

proposed as a technique for increasing compliance with use of surgical checklists and other
CQI innovations.

The Business Case
for CQI

Health care delivery systems are large, decentralized, and complex, yet at their core they
involve a fundamental personal relationship
between providers and patients. Moreover, if
this were not a sufficient challenge, rapid and
uncertain changes in the structure and processes of providing and paying for care make
measuring the effect of any single management intervention over time very difficult, if
not impossible. Although evidence has been
accumulated from both controlled trials
(Goldberg, Wagner, & Finh, 1998; Mehta et al.,
2000; Solberg, 1993) and survey data (Shortell,
Bennett, & Byck, 1998) on the implementation
process and perceived impact, much of the
evidence remains anecdotal (Arndt & Bigelow,
1995; Bigelow & Arndt, 1995). Leatherman
et al. (2003), for example, argue that the “business case” for quality improvement is yet to be
proven, even while evidence mounts for the
overall societal and economic benefits:
A business case for a health care
improvement intervention exists if
the entity that invests in the intervention realizes a financial return on its
investment in a reasonable time frame,
using a reasonable rate of discounting. This may be realized as “bankable
dollars” (profit), a reduction in losses
for a given program or population, or
avoided costs. In addition, a business
case may exist if the investing entity
believes that a positive indirect impact
on organization function and sustainability will accrue within a reasonable
time frame. (p. 18)

37

These arguments continue; the economic
case includes the returns to all the actors, not
just the individual investing business unit. The
social case, as they define it, is one of measuring benefits, but not requiring positive returns
on the investment. That has been overriding the
consideration in the battle to control medical
variation and medical errors (McGlynn, Asch,
& Adams, 2003). The business case for quality
improvement suffers from the same negative
factors as the business case for other preventive health care measures—namely, all or part
of the benefits accruing to other business units
or patients, and delayed impacts that get discounted heavily in the reckoning (Leatherman
et al., 2003). The regulatory arguments for quality improvement efforts have generally been
justified on the basis of social and economic
benefits such as lives saved and overall cost
reductions, but these arguments are not necessarily profitable to the investor. These authors
also present a whole array of public policy
measures that would overcome the barriers to
a positive business case and encourage wider
and more assertive implementation of quality improvement methods. Clearly, economics
alone does not provide an argument strongly for
or against the use of CQI, but it does add to the
complexity that pervades the wider and more
rapid implementation of CQI in health care.
In summary, this brief overview indicates
that a strong business case for CQI in health
care cannot be made. Looking back over the
past 40 years, Robert Brook, UCLA Professor
of Medicine and Health Services and Distinguished Chair in Health Care Services for the
RAND Corporation, observes, “Although there
are some examples in the literature to support
the concept that better quality of care is less
expensive, few studies have produced information that could be generalized across time and
institutional settings” (Brook, 2010, p. 1831).
Building on the traditional business concepts
that have been discussed and in consideration
of the limited evidence to support the business case for CQI, a transformation that may

38

Chapter 2 Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care

support greater diffusion of CQI and the continuing need to bridge the quality chasm is
to consider a more value-based approach to
CQI in health care. This approach argues for
simultaneous goals of higher quality and lower
cost, which will only be achieved when there
is a reorientation among CQI proponents that
includes a thorough understanding of how to
achieve a positive return on investment (Brook,
2010). This view is consistent with the Triple
Aim of Health Care described by Berwick,
Nolan, and Whittington (2008) and its most
recent recommended enhancement, the Quadruple Aim (Bodenheimer & Sinsky, 2014); it
will be discussed in greater detail in the final
chapter of this text (Chapter 14), which will
address future quality trends in health care.

Factors Associated
with Successful CQI
Applications

Despite the need for greater diffusion of CQI in
health care, much progress has been made, suggesting a broad array of factors that can be associated with successful CQI implementation.
The key to greater diffusion is understanding
and emphasizing those factors that work while
exploring new concepts, such as the value focus
described previously. This analysis starts with
regulatory (e.g., accreditation) factors and
organizational factors such as leadership, organizational culture, and teamwork; and finishes
with individual providers’ internal/intrinsic
motivation, perhaps the most important factor
for adoption of innovations and CQI.

Capturing the Intellectual
Capital of the Workforce
Industrial managers are increasingly recognizing that frontline workers know their work
processes better than the management does.
Therefore, management encourages workers to

apply that knowledge and insight to the firm’s
processes. This is especially true in health care,
where the professionals employed by or practicing in the institution control the technological core of the organization. Management that
does not capitalize on this available pool of
professional and specialized knowledge within
the organization is naive at best.

Reducing Managerial Overhead
Some companies have been able to remove layers of management as work groups have taken
responsibility for their own processes. Health
care organizations are actually already limited in the number of staff positions, mostly
because the professionals, rather than the corporate staff, have clinical process knowledge.
Indeed, one might view the new investments
in CQI as a catching-up process for the lack
of process-oriented staff that are involved in
process enhancement in most other industries.
This is but another example of how the incentives in health care are misaligned. Since physicians are not employees in most community
hospitals, they are not at risk when processes
are suboptimal, unless the situation is so bad
that it prompts a lawsuit.

Lateral Linkages
Health care organizations are characterized by
their many medical specialties, each organized
into its own professional fiefdom. Specialization is just one response to an information
overload in the organization (Galbraith, 1973).
By specializing, each unit tends to learn more
and more about less and less. One way to
offset the effects of this specialization is to
provide lateral linkages—coordinators, integrating mechanisms—to get the information
moving across the organization as well as up
and down the chain of command (Galbraith,
1973; Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967). So far, that
has proved very difficult in health care institutions. CQI, through its use of interdisciplinary
teams and its focus on a broader definition

Factors Associated with Successful CQI Applications

of process and system as it affects customers
rather than professional groups, presents one
way to establish linkages. The technology of
CQI focuses as much on coordination of the
change process as on its motivation. In modern medicine, as practiced in the 21st century,
this coordination and motivation of CQI is
bolstered by the need for greater coordination
in medical care in general and is therefore
quite natural. There is a greater emphasis on
interdisciplinary care, which leads to fostering
interdependence and, in turn, better teamwork, including greater employee engagement
and improvements in the patient experience
and the financial performance of practices
(Swensen et al., 2010).

Regulatory Agencies and
Accreditation
Regulatory mechanisms such as accreditation
are key factors that have led to greater diffusion of CQI and will continue to do so in the
future as a direct result of mandated measurement and improvement of the quality of care.
Chapter 12 will provide a broad overview of
accreditation and its impact across the globe,
but for the purposes of this discussion, a focus
on the United States is illustrative.
In the United States, the efforts of The
Joint Commission (TJC) and CMS have led
to the implementation of a series of initiatives
that require hospitals to report on quality
measures; after a period of strong resistance,
routine reporting of key metrics is now commonplace and required for accreditation by
TJC; and has been reinforced by provisions in
the ACA (Somander, 2015). Also, as described
in Chapters 11 and 12 of this text, accreditation initiatives at the national and state levels
have served as an impetus for CQI in public health agencies in the United States. The
local health department accreditation system
in North Carolina also serves as an example
of CQI innovation at a state-wide level, as it
was one of the first states to implement mandatory public health accreditation, which

39

has led to sustainable CQI efforts (Stone &
Davis, 2012).
Likewise, CMS generates extensive CQI
activities and associated reporting of findings via the efforts of Quality Improvement
Organizations (QIOs). QIOs represent a clear
example of diffusion of CQI in health care and
continue to play an important role in ensuring the highest quality of care to the millions
of beneficiaries covered by Medicare in the
United States. QIOs are a clear example of
diffusion, as they grew from what they were
in 1972 when they were termed Professional
Standards Review Organizations (PSROs)
(Schenck, McArdle, & Weiser, 2013). (For an
in-depth discussion and to provide a series
of academic questions to be considered for
understanding how QIOs work, readers are
referred to an illustrative case study provided
by Rokoske, McCardle, and Schenck, 2012.)
The processes for each of these regulatory
mechanisms provide evidence for factors to be
considered, as well as lessons learned, in regard
to further diffusion of CQI in health care.
For example, the impact of the measurement
requirements has been notable. In a review
published by members of TJC, this impact was
described as being due to the use of robust,
evidence-based measures, which link process
performance and patient outcomes (Chassin,
Loeb, Schmaltz, & Wachter, 2010). Despite
extensive documentation of successes in the
article, these authors also note the need and
define a direction for further improvement,
centered on process measurement. They point
out that the focus of this measurement process is entirely on hospital care, leaving much
to be done in regard to ambulatory care. They
also note that the measures in place are process measures, not outcome measures. In the
spirit of continuous improvement, they offer
guidance in improving the measures that are
currently in place.
Once again, this program, while not without problems, is a good model for further diffusion of CQI; early resistance to measurement
no longer exists, and now the issue is more

40

Chapter 2 Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care

about finding the most effective measures,
with little resistance expected from hospitals
and physicians. In the language of diffusion of
innovation, TJC has passed the early adoption
stage and is now well into the institutionalization stage, at least in the hospital sector, and
relative to a subset of process measures. However, despite their optimism about the progress that has been made and the value of their
proposed measurement framework, Chassin
et al. (2010) close their discussion of these new
accountability measures by realistically pointing out that perpetual vigilance is required to
review and improve the measurement process
via feedback from internal and external customers. So a partial answer to our question
of how to “fix the broken system” is provided
by accreditation, and much has been accomplished, with some guidance from TJC on
what to do next. However, these comments are
specific to measurement of processes in hospitals, and a more general answer is still needed
to truly address the broader health care system
and its subcomponents.

Motivational Factors
A number of motivational factors contribute
to the sustained interest and enthusiasm for
health care improvement. These factors have
an impact on the motivation of the management of the organization and its employees.
The first argument for CQI is its direct impact
on quality, usually a net gain to the customer/
patient and to the employees of the organization, the external and internal customers. The
second argument relates to the set of benefits
associated with a plan that empowers employees in health care through participation in
decision making. These factors represent benefits for employees and management that can
be classified as follows.

Internal/Intrinsic Motivation
With the proper internal or intrinsic motivation, the vast majority of health care workers

support the concept of quality care and would
like to see improvements and participate in
a meaningful quality improvement process.
Allowing personnel to work on their own processes, permitting them to “do the right thing,”
and then rewarding them for that behavior is
almost sure to increase intrinsic motivation
in employees, if done properly. It is a classic
case of empowerment and job enrichment
for health care workers and follows the principle clearly delineated by Deming about the
important role of internal (vs. external) motivation and employee engagement in CQI
efforts. It should be noted that internal and
intrinsic motivation will be used interchangeably throughout this text, representating the
form of motivation that Deming describes as
being linked to self-esteem and dignity (1993).

System of Profound Knowledge
It is well known that the system of profound
knowledge and the original 14 points of Deming (see Chapter 1) emphasize high levels of
trust, empowerment, and especially internal
motivation and engagement as important factors associated with implementation of CQI
initiatives (Deming, 1986,; 1993). This is clearly
and succinctly emphasized in Deming’s point
number 12: “remove barriers that rob people
of pride of workmanship” (Deming, 1986,
p. 77). In health care, and especially in nursing and medicine, one indication of demotivation and lack of engagement is the increasing
rate of burnout and work dissatisfaction in
recent years (Shanafelt et al., 2015). A systematic review and meta-analysis reported
in The Lancet in 2016 described physician
burnout as reaching epidemic proportions
(West, Dyrbye, Erwin, and Shanafelt, 2016).
Burnout, which can be defined as the opposite of engagement, is indicated by emotional
exhaustion, depersonalization and perceived
lack of personal accomplishment; and in
health care, burnout is manifested by diminished personal well-being and longevity and
leads to decreased quality of patient care

Factors Associated with Successful CQI Applications

(Chew et al., 2017). Provider burnout has also
been linked to greater patient dissatisfaction
and higher costs. Examples that have been
cited of lower quality/safety of care resulting
from burnout include prescribing inappropriate medications (Bodenheimer & Sinsky,
2014). Reports of physician burnout have
been persistent during the second decade of
the 21st century, as indicated by findings from
two large studies, which reported prevalence
of at least one symptom of burnout as high
as 54.4% in 2014 (Shanafelt et al., 2015) compared to 45.5% in 2011 (Shanafelt et al., 2012).
In both studies, the sample sizes consisted of
over 3,000 responding physicians; although
response rates were in the 20% range, which
may compromise the ability these data have to
serve as predictors of population parameters,
the consistency and large sample size that these
findings are based on are indicative of a longterm trend that burnout is consistent and may
be worsening over the time period between
these two studies. Other studies in the United
States and Europe of a range of types of health
care providers, including nurses and staff as
well as physicians, yield similar findings. For
example, one provider survey, in 2013, in the
United States found that 60% of respondents
reported burnout and 34% indicated that they
planned to look for another job (Bodenheimer
& Sinsky 2014). A 2015 survey of British
physicians reported that 44% of respondents
reported very low or low morale, with similar findings for nurses and health care staff
(Sikka, Morath, & Leape, 2015).
Among the various factors that thwart
innovation and CQI implementation, burnout and low morale are often mentioned not
only for the sake of encouraging innovation,
but more importantly, to improve the health
and well-being of health care providers. A key
question for all in health care and specifically
to address the topic of this chapter is how to
reverse these trends; how to eliminate factors
that may be causally related to burnout and
how to identify factors that will increase the
rate of innovation and CQI implementation.

41

From Triple Aim to
Quadruple Aim
An important innovative concept that was first
introduced in 2008 is the Triple Aim of Health
Care (Berwick, Nolan, & Whittington, 2008).
This innovation broadens the goals and definition of quality health care through the simultaneous pursuit of three aims: “improving the
experience of care, improving the health of
populations, and reducing the per capita costs
of health care” (Berwick, Nolan, & Whittington, 2008, p. 759). Since its introduction, the
adoption of the Triple Aim has become a goal
of many health care providers both nationally
and globally and can be viewed as a new stage
in the ongoing evolution of CQI in health
care; it has done so by using a systems optimization perspective and has taken advantage
of associated innovations that have facilitated
the implementation of systems to pursue the
Triple Aim. For example, adoption of the Triple Aim has benefited from improvements in
technology, such as the broader overall use
and the institutionalization, at least in large
hospital systems, of electronic health records.
It has also benefited from CQI tools and techniques that have become more widely adopted
in recent years such as elimination of waste
in health care processes via LEAN/Six Sigma,
described in Chapter 5.
The introduction of the Triple Aim is
an example of innovation in health care
systems, and the application of a systems
approach utilizing synergy derived from the
interdependence of the three aims. However,
this interdependence requires careful attention to system optimization since changing
any one has a direct impact on the other
two aims. This important characteristic has
direct implications on the further adoption
of CQI in health care, which requires that
intrinsic motivation for change and improvement is maintained by providers. For example, if cost reductions lead to overburdening
busy providers with lower leverage tasks,
then they may not be motivated to identify

42

Chapter 2 Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care

and implement new CQI ideas. The costreduction mentality that is described in some
business models as “doing more with less”
can also lead, in health care, to poorer quality
and lower patient satisfaction if tradeoffs are
not carefully understood and managed.

Quadruple Aim
Although many health care providers have
adopted the Triple Aim, others have not been
able to do so successfully. One explanation
for less than full implementation may be that
“practices working toward the Triple Aim may
increase physician burnout and thereby reduce
their chances of success” (Bodenheimer &
Sinsky, 2014, p. 575). A partial explanation for
this trend is that some of the very same factors
that lead to successful adoption of the Triple
Aim may have inadvertently led to burnout and
demotivation among some health care providers. For example, the widespread increase in
utilization of electronic health records, a plus
factor for implementing the Triple Aim, has
been shown to lead to increases in burnout
(Babbott et al., 2014).
Provider burnout and dissatisfaction, the
opposite of internal motivation and engagement, may also lead to a reluctance to adopt
or lead the development of innovations/CQI
initiatives. Because of its possible causative
links to burnout, the Triple Aim, while by definition designed to lead to greater CQI implementation and innovation in health care, may
inadvertently have the opposite effect, at least
in some cases.
To address this conflict in positive and
negative effects of pursuing the Triple Aim, one
solution that has been proposed is to expand the
Triple Aim by adding a fourth aim—improving
the work life of clinicians and health care staff
and increasing the experience of joy and meaning in health care work (Bodenheimer &
Sinsky, 2014; Sikka, Morath, & Leape, 2015).
The key question is, how?
As with many CQI initiatives the solution
of expanding from a Triple Aim to a Quadruple

Aim must start with a system-level focus. For
example, one form of system optimization that
is proposed to implement the Quadruple Aim
for primary care is to shift relevant responsibilities from physicians to practice staff but
at the same time ensuring that “staff who
assume new responsibilities are well trained
and understand that they are contributing to
the health of their patients and that unnecessary work is reengineered out of the practice”
(Bodenheimer & Sinsky, 2014, p. 575). This
approach represents just one of many possible
system changes that can be included under the
umbrella of empowerment, a well-established,
cost-effective approach to improve internal
motivation and engagement (Daft, 2015).
It also requires attention to the concept of
task-relevant maturity for ensuring that those
who are empowered are prepared to accept
greater responsibility, including receiving adequate training (Grove, 1995). The successful
application of these concepts may require an
initial investment in dollars and time that will
offer a future return on investment. And most
important, it requires a culture that is open to
transformational leadership concepts (Daft,
2015) such as empowerment and a vision that
embraces innovation and improvement; such
a culture is described in the next section of
this chapter.
In summary, the concept and effectiveness of the Triple Aim will be further
improved by the addition of a fourth aim that
focuses on the welfare of providers because
“maintaining a balance between workforce
satisfaction and patient satisfaction will be
critical in achieving the fourth aim. Reductions in physician and staff burnout will
support the primary goal of the Triple Aim,
improving population health” (AHRQ, 2015).
Stated more succinctly, “health care is a
relationship between those who provide
care and those who seek care, a relationship that can only thrive if it is symbiotic”
(Bodenheimer & Sinsky, 2014, p. 575). And
this symbiotic relationship is at the core of
successful CQI implementation.

Culture of Excellence

▸

Culture of Excellence

Throughout the history of the application of
CQI, one of the most important factors associated with successful applications of CQI
has been the interaction of leadership, organizational culture, teamwork and internal
motivation. Transformational leadership, distinguished by its emphasis on vision, is a starting point and a consistent force in motivating
change and improvement. “Transformational
leadership is characterized by the ability to
bring about significant change in both followers and the organization. Transformational
leaders have the ability to lead changes in the
organization’s vison, strategy and culture as
well as promote innovation in products and
technologies” (Daft, 2015, p. 360). To ensure
CQI, the most important role of a leader is
transformation (Deming, 1993), which starts
with a motivating vision that must be developed, communicated, and embraced by all
in the organization, and which in turn leads
to high levels of commitment to the vision of
change and improvement (Melum & Sinioris,
1993; Tichy & Devanna, 1986). Leaders ensure
commitment to the vision by shaping a culture that not only accepts but embraces change
(Balestracci, 2009; Schein, 1991). FIGURE 2.1
describes the way in which this is accomplished
in an organization that is dedicated to CQI and

thereby defines a set of factors that are critical
to the greater diffusion of CQI in health care.
The development of and commitment to a
vision leads to what Deming called constancy
of purpose for all in the organization, referring
to a clear sense of where the organization is
going or what a system is intended to accomplish (Deming, 1986). The type of culture that
is needed to succeed in an organization whose
goal is to continuously improve can be called
a “culture of excellence.” This concept is similar to a “safety culture,” defined as a culture
in which “a commitment to safety permeates
all levels of the organization from frontline
personnel to executive management” (AHRQ,
2011). Also similar is a clearly defined, shared
vision that translates into detailed procedures,
decision-making processes based on teamwork,
and strategic actions that lead to achievement
of the vision of quality and safety. A culture of
excellence is one that ensures high quality at
every customer interface and in which a commitment to the highest quality—and CQI, in
particular—is shared by all in the organization.
Underlying the creation of a culture of
excellence is a need for a systems view. A systems view of health care emphasizes the importance of adding value and the importance of
leadership rather than management, influence
rather than power, and the alignment of incentives focused on quality rather than quantity of
services (Rouse, 2008). A culture of excellence

customer), there may be some discomfort with the generic term “customer,”
especially among physicians and nurses
(Houpt, Gilkey, & Ehringhaus, 2015).
There should be awareness of this issue,
especially when developing a culture to
embrace the ideas presented here, but
for simplicity and consistency with terminology presented here and in the CQI
literature in general, the term customer
will continue to be used—as a term
that denotes the highest respect for the
patients, their families and communities
served in health care.
Systems thinking: Maintaining a goal of
optimizing the system as a whole and
thereby creating synergy (Deming, 1986;
Spath & Kelly, 2017).
Statistical thinking: Understanding causes
of variation and the importance of learning from measurement; having the ability
to use data to make decisions (see Chapter
4 and Balestracci, 2009).
Teamwork: Teams of peers working together
to ensure empowerment, thereby creating
the highest levels of motivation to ensure
alignment of the organization, the team,
and the individual around the CQI vision
(see Chapter 6 and Grove, 1995).
Motivation and empowerment: A key
component of the culture of excellence is
its ability to increase empowerment and
internal motivation necessary for any
successful CQI initiative (Deming, 1986,
1993). Ultimately, this will lead to higher

■

levels of engagement. “The most recent
thinking about motivation considers what
factors contribute to people’s willingness
to be fully engaged at work and “go the
extra mile” to contribute their creativity, energy and passion on the job. One
approach is to foster an organizational
environment that helps people find true
value and meaning in their work. One
path to meaning is through employee
engagement” (Daft, 2015, pp. 245–246). A
culture of excellence creates an environment where empowerment, motivation
and engagement are the norm. It should
ultimately address the need for “joy in
work” by providing a platform for the
Quadruple Aim to be achieved; and in a
cyclical manner this will in turn further
increase the motivation of health care providers to be innovative and embrace CQI
initiatives.
Communication and feedback: Maintaining open channels of communication and
feedback to make adjustments as needed,
including modifying the vision to achieve
higher levels of quality in a manner
consistent with a learning organization
(Senge, 1990), including feedback that is
fact-based and given with true concern
for individuals’ organizational success
(Balestracci, 2009). Open communication
and feedback are key characteristics of the
team approach necessary to achieve the
goals of CQI (see Chapter 6).

Leadership and Diffusion
In discussing factors that support the implementation of CQI, the theory of diffusion of
innovation clearly supports the important role
of leadership in CQI. A capacity for innovation,
as described in the literature of organizational
psychology, is seen as critically dependent on
good leadership; one of the key factors to the
implementation and routinization of innovation once adopted is the consultation and

Culture of Excellence

active involvement of leaders—and especially
leadership by example. Furthermore, organizational leadership is critical to the development
of a culture that fosters innovation (Greenhalgh
et al., 2005 ). CQI is a form of change and innovation that also requires cultural change driven
by leadership. As Greenhalgh et al. explain,
“Leaders within organizations are critical firstly
in creating a cultural context that fosters innovation and secondly, establishing organizational
strategy, structure, and systems that facilitate
innovation” (2005, p. 69). This perspective ties
directly back to Deming’s point about leadership: leaders must know and understand the
processes they are responsible for and lead
by example, acting as part of the improvement effort and on the “corrections” required
(Deming, 1986). This point was emphasized
by Gawande (2009, p. 146) in describing how
the initial adoption of surgical checklists was
accomplished:
Using the checklist involved a major
cultural change, as well—a shift in
authority, responsibility, and expectations about care—and the hospitals needed to recognize that. We
gambled that their staff would be far
more likely to adopt the checklist if
they saw their leadership accepting it
from the outset.

Leaders at All Levels
Various types of leaders can contribute to (or
detract from) the innovation process. Traditional organizational and team leaders are
most often associated with CQI initiatives;
however, in regard to innovations, the terminology of “leader” can be expanded to include
opinion leaders, champions, and boundary
spanners.
Opinion leaders represent a broad range
of leaders “within the ranks” as well as those at
the top level. In clinical settings, opinion leaders have influence on the beliefs and actions of

45

their colleagues, either positive or negative in
regard to embracing innovation. Opinion leaders may be experts who are respected for their
formal academic authority in regard to a particular innovation; their support represents a form
of evidence-based knowledge. Opinion leaders
may also be peers who are respected for their
know-how and understanding of the realities of
clinical practice (Greenhalgh et al., 2005).
Unlike opinion leaders, who may support or oppose an innovation, champions persistently support new ideas. They may come
from the top management of an organization,
including technical or business experts. Champions include team and project leaders and
others who have perseverance to fight both
resistance and/or indifference to promote the
acceptance of a new idea or to achieve project
goals (Greenhalgh et al., 2005).
Boundary spanners represent a combination of these various types of leaders and are
distinguished by the fact that they have influence across organizational and other boundaries (Greenhalgh et al., 2005; Kaluzny, Veney,
& Gentry, 1974). Boundary spanners play an
important role in multi-organizational innovations and quality improvement initiatives,
such as quality improvement collaboratives.
Each of these types of leaders is found in the
adoption of quality improvement initiatives in
health care, and often these various types of
leaders are found in combination.

Teamwork
CQI in health care is a team game. These
teams are composed of peers who are highly
trained technical experts supporting each
other and empowered to take a leadership role
as required to meet the needs of customers.
Teamwork is one of the most important components of all successful CQI initiatives; team
building centers on the ability to create teams
of empowered and motivated people who are
leaders themselves and who will take the lead
as needed to foster change, innovation, and

46

Chapter 2 Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care

improvement (Byham & Cox, 1998; Grove
1995; Kotter, 1996). The glue that holds a culture of excellence together and that ensures
there will be quality at every interface is the
link between leadership and teamwork—with
leadership exhibited as called for at all levels
within a team. As Deming states, “There is no
substitute for teamwork and good leaders of
teams to bring consistency of effort along with
knowledge” (1986, p. 19).

Motivation and Empowerment
Inherent in teamwork is a high level of empowerment of team members, which in turn leads
to high levels of motivation. Empowerment
implies that levels of authority match levels
of responsibility and training. For example,
suggestions and interventions can be made
to allow improvements and prevent problems
or errors. This initiative goes beyond simply
allowing team members to speak up; it means
ensuring they are comfortable speaking up
when something seems wrong (Byham & Cox,
1998; Deming, 1986; Grove, 1995).
Improved motivation is the direct result
of transformational leadership and especially
its emphasis on empowerment. Motivation
and empowerment both will interact to lead
to higher quality; but to work, these elements
require another aspect of cultural change and
associated leadership responsibility—building
a culture of trust. This is emphasized in Deming’s 14 points, namely point number 8: Drive
out fear. Create trust. Create a climate for innovation (see Chapter 1). Deming explains, “No
one can put in his best performance unless he
feels secure. … Secure means without fear, not
afraid to express ideas, not afraid to ask questions” (1986, p. 59). This ties directly back to
the surgical checklist example as well as the
airline safety tradition, where use of a checklist implies responsibility to communicate and
question each other as part of the checklist
process, regardless of the team member’s rank.
A leader’s goal must be to create a culture
where people are empowered to do their jobs

to the best of their abilities, with trust and a
clear understanding of the vision that creates
the constancy of purpose needed to achieve
the highest quality.
Training is critical to the success of leaders
and the ability to achieve constancy of purpose,
not only training of employees in the skills
required to do their jobs, which removes barriers to motivation, but also training the future
leaders of the organization, which creates further motivation. Training of future leaders is
one of the most important responsibilities of
a leader (Tichy, 1997). And it is a key characteristic of transformational leadership; “transformational leadership inspires followers …
motivates people to do more than originally
expected … develops followers into leaders”
(Daft, 2015, p. 361). Gawande (2009) addresses
this issue in describing the process for testing
and implementing the surgical safety checklist.
Despite the obvious key role of the surgeon,
it was decided that the “circulating nurse” on
the surgery team would be the one to start the
checklist process at the beginning of a surgery.
This was done for several reasons, but one of
the most important was “to spread responsibility and the power to question” (p. 137).

Examples of Leadership and
Teamwork in CQI
The linkage between leadership and teamwork
to ensure success in quality improvement in
health care has been demonstrated in many
instances, including the very successful implementation of quality improvement collaboratives (QICs). QICs represent a form of virtual
organizations (Byrne, 1993) the effectiveness
of which have been demonstrated in industry
for many years. Part of the success of QICs
can be tied to this effective team structure. For
example, in describing the successful application of a QIC using the IHI Breakthrough
series (Kilo, 1998) in 40 U.S. hospitals to reduce
adverse drug events, Leape et al. (2000) identify strong leadership and teamwork among
their most important success factors: “Success

Kotter’s Change Model

in making significant changes was associated
with strong leadership, effective processes, and
appropriate choice of intervention. Successful
teams were able to define, clearly state, and
relentlessly pursue their aims, and then chose
practical interventions and moved early into
changing a process” (Greenhalgh et al., 2005,
p. 165). Further examples of QICs and their
importanace in the future of CQI in health
care are presented in Chapter 14.
In summary, leadership, effective teamwork, and the empowerment of teams, which
lead to higher levels of internal motivation,
have been critical factors in the evolution of
CQI in health care and are directly related to
the pace and broad adoption of CQI in health
care in recent years. Chapter 6 provides a
detailed description of how to build teams and
ensure that they operate most effectively to
improve quality in health care. Grove (1995)
provides examples of how to create an organizational structure that supports multiple
teams working in parallel and how to ensure
efficiency in doing so.

Kotter’s Change Model

A traditional model that is used to define a
culture of change and in particular the role of
vision and leadership is the eight-stage change
model developed by John Kotter (1996), which
is outlined in BOX 2.1. The discussion of leadership, organizational culture, and teamwork presented previously described “what is” the type
of culture that is needed to implement successful CQI initiatives; Kotter’s model describes
“how to” implement major change and also
provides guidance on traditional errors to
avoid. These two approaches are closely
related. There is clear overlap between Kotter’s
model and the factors defined in Figure 2.1,
which describe the culture of excellence. These
common elements include empowerment,
communication, feedback loops to produce
more change, and, most important, the central role of vision and anchoring change in the

culture. The presentation of Kotter’s model,
which is well known with widespread application beyond health care, also serves as validation for the basic concepts of the Culture of
Excellence Model.
One key point of Kotter’s model that is
worthy of a bit more discussion here is his first
point: “Establishing a sense of urgency.” This
point relates to an earlier discussion about
how long it takes, or should take, to implement CQI concepts. The emphasis is not that
decisions should be rushed, but that complacency is to be avoided. Complacency may be
due to many reasons that can be associated
with the need for CQI in health care. These
include, according to Kotter, “too much past
success, lack of visible crises, low performance
standards, [and] insufficient feedback from
external constituencies. … Without a sense
of urgency, people won’t give that extra effort
that is essential. They won’t make needed sacrifices. Instead they cling to the status quo and
resist initiatives from above” (1996, p. 5). This
point directly relates to CQI in health care; the
importance of ensuring safety and quality in
health care requires a sense of urgency.
See Kotter’s text for a comprehensive
description of the elements in Box 2.1 and the
broader subject of how to implement organizational change.

Chapter 2 Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care

Conclusions

Despite the increased use of CQI and a good
understanding of the philosophy and processes
of CQI, its effectiveness and further adoption
in health care remain subjects of ongoing concern. The literature on diffusion of innovation
suggests some guidelines to understand factors
that influence the adoption of CQI. Understanding the factors that enable or influence
adoption of CQI, as well as the factors that present barriers, is particularly important as more
countries around the world are utilizing CQI
to solve health challenges, including resourcepoor countries and as national health initiatives are being modified or introduced around
the world, including in the United States.
Among the factors that are gaining greater
attention is the emphasis on cost, efficiency
and value. The emphasis on value is directly
correlated with concerns about the costs of

quality health care and has led to novel concepts such as the Triple Aim of health care—
simultaneously focusing on care, health, and
cost. At the same time, the critical role of
internal motivation, that was emphasized by
CQI pioneers, such as W. Edwards Deming,
as central to ongoing implementation of CQI,
leads to consideration of a fourth aim, improving the motivation and work life of health
care providers. This consideration has been
driven in part by demotivation resulting from
increasing rates of burnout that have been
reported among health care providers. Central
to promoting the diffusion of innovation, and
in particular CQI, is leadership, vision,
and teamwork, resulting in empowerment
and motivation of the health care workforce.
A model that combines these factors to ensure
the continuing adoption of CQI in health care,
and including the goals of the Quadruple Aim,
is the implementation of a culture of excellence
as described and defined in this chapter.

T

he most consistent challenges to continuous quality improvement (CQI)
throughout its evolution in health care
have been ensuring the broadest adoption of
evidence-based improvements in practice and
motivating research into further improvements
of processes and outcomes.The challenge of
how to maximize adoption of CQI-proven
practices is addressed in this chapter through
an introduction to implementation science as
a methodology to increase the adoption and
implementation of innovations and improvements in health care-practice settings. Drawing
on its multidisciplinary roots and applications,

implementation science represents a next step
in the evolution of CQI in health care.

Implementation
Science Defined

Implementation is “a specified set of activities
designed to put into practice, an activity, or
program” (NIRN, 2018). Even if we know the
interventions needed to implement or improve
a program, we still need a scientific approach
to make sure that these activities are executed
in a way that results in their effective use. We
also need to learn from this experience to
accelerate change more broadly.
The emerging field of implementation
science involves the systematic study of how
to improve the quality of implementation of
interventions and programs that are known

to work, typically in health care, public health,
behavioral health, education, and other settings where sustainable solutions at scale are
difficult to achieve. Implementation science
has a number of definitions, but it can be
understood as the “scientific study of methods
to promote the systematic uptake of research
findings and other evidence-based practices
into routine practice, and, hence, to improve
the quality and effectiveness of health services
and care … (this) field includes the study of
influences on health care professional and
organizational behavior.” Recognizing the
importance of how and where these interventions are implemented, the National Implementation Research Network (NIRN) also
defines the field as “the study of factors that
influence the full and effective use of innovations in practice” (NIRN, 2018). In this chapter,
we describe the key principles of implementation science and how integrating these principles into improvement strategies can be a
valuable step to helping quality improvement
(QI) programs achieve their desired results.
While the use of QI methods such as
Lean, Six Sigma (see Chapter 5), or the Model
for Improvement (introduced in Chapter 1)
to improve systems and processes in health
care is now well established, there is still much
debate about the effectiveness of these methods. For example, a recent systematic review
of Lean methods concluded that there is little

evidence to support the claim that Lean leads
to improved health care (Moraros, Lemstra,
& Nwankwo, 2016). The lack of a systematic
approach to implementation is one reason
for this conclusion. The most common QI
methodologies do not incorporate a systematic approach to the implementation of the
improvement solution—a failing that can
lead to an incorrect conclusion that the solution isn’t effective. For example, Six Sigma’s
Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control
(DMAIC) process (FIGURE 3.1) moves directly
from the Improve step (where improvement
solutions are generated and prioritized) to the
Control step (where the post-improvement
process is monitored for stability) without any
mention of the context-specific details needed
to guide the implementation of the selected
solutions. The Wall Street Journal reports that
60% of Six Sigma projects fail to achieve the
desired results, because “in the middle stage of
an improvement project—when the Six Sigma
expert moves on to another project and top
management turns it focus to another group
of workers—implementation starts to wobble,
and teams may find themselves struggling to
maintain the gains they achieved early on”
(Chakravorty, 2010). The three questions framing the Model for Improvement (FIGURE 3.2)
are structured to help teams develop improvement solutions but do not address their implementation and often neglect the broader

Integrating Implementation into QI: The Model for Improvement and Implementation

organizational changes needed for immediate
success as well as sustainability of change.
In other words, it is not enough to use QI
methods rigorously to come up with a solution
that works. It is equally important to be rigorous
about applying the approaches and tools from
implementation science to put these solutions
into effective practice and sustain the changes.
The key ingredients needed for interventions to achieve successful outcomes are summarized in FIGURE 3.3 (Bertram, Blase, & Fixsen,

FIGURE 3.3 Key Ingredients for Achieving Outcomes
Modified from National Implementation Research Network

methods can help to develop. But the intervention is just one ingredient. An implementation
approach appropriate to the setting and resources
and a supportive organizational, policy, or funding environment are needed as well. The multiplicative nature of these “ingredients” means
that failure in any of these steps will decrease the
chance that desired outcomes are achieved.
FIGURE 3.4 shows how quality improvement methods and implementation science
approaches can work together to achieve
effective outcomes in health care and in public health. Systematic improvement methods
help to create effective interventions (sometimes referred to as change packages) that fit
the local context. Implementation science
methods can be used to identify appropriate
implementation strategies to ensure effective
implementation of the change package.

shown in FIGURE 3.5, as the Model for Improvement and Implementation (MFII). This model
incorporates three implementation questions
into the traditional model for improvement.
The implementation questions begin
with implementation outcomes, which are the
desired results of the implementation of the

change package. Analogous to improvement
aims, these outcomes specify the implementation aims to ensure quality implementation in a
particular setting or context, such as feasibility,
fidelity, acceptability, or cost. The second question addresses implementation determinants,
or factors that may affect the implementation

Integrating Implementation into QI: The Model for Improvement and Implementation

outcomes in that context. And finally, the third
question identifies implementation strategies,
which are implementation interventions to
address the determinants that may impede the
achievement of the implementation and ultimately the QI outcomes. The Plan, Do, Study,
Act (PDSA) cycles test and refine these strategies so that they fit the implementation context. As a result of this testing, it may become
apparent that the change package is inappropriate for the context and may need to be modified or adapted. This will initiate the redesign
of the change package and the creation of a
new improvement solution. Improvement and
implementation are thus intrinsically connected in the joint model.

Implementation Outcomes
The first implementation question of the MFII
is intimately connected to the first improvement question, What are we trying to accomplish?, because we cannot achieve health
improvement goals if improvement interventions are not implemented well. Implementation outcomes are defined as “the effects of
deliberate and purposive actions to implement new treatments, practices, and services”
(Proctor et al., 2011). In other words, implementation outcomes measure how well the
implementation process worked, since the
quality of the implementation process affects
how well the QI intervention achieves the

55

desired health outcomes. There are more than
500 studies offering evidence that the quality
of implementation affects health outcomes
(Durlak & DuPre, 2008).
The link between implementation outcomes and quality of care outcomes (defined
here as service outcome and patient/client outcomes) is shown in FIGURE 3.6 (from Proctor
et al., 2011). There are eight implementation
outcomes shown in the figure, and their definitions are provided in TABLE 3.1.
Quality improvement project teams can
use Figure 3.6 to select the implementation
outcomes most likely to affect the achievement of their improvement aims. For example, an improvement intervention that relies
on fast ambulance services to improve referral processes affecting the timeliness of care
may not be feasible or may be too expensive
in low-resource settings where ambulance services are not easily available. In this context,
feasibility and cost may be the most important
implementation outcomes that affect the ability to improve timeliness of care. In the case of
an intervention focusing on improving patient
satisfaction by enhanced provider/patient
communication, acceptability of new communication protocols by providers may be the
primary implementation outcome of interest.
For a hand-hygiene intervention, adoption by
clinicians may affect the reduction in health
care-associated infection (HCAI) prevalence.
In this case, adoption may vary by facility and

the adoption rates may be affected by differences in acceptability of the intervention, and
it therefore may be necessary to pay attention
to both outcomes.
How should these implementation outcomes be integrated into the work of QI teams?
After teams have defined the change package to
be implemented as part of the QI initiative, they
will consider the implementation questions in
MFII and determine the implementation outcomes that are most relevant to the successful
implementation of their change package. They
will collect baseline measures for their selected
outcomes and set targets for the implementation outcomes that will result in sustained
achievement of the improvement outcome.
Implementation outcomes can be measured in a variety of ways. Perceptual measures
such as feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness,
or adoption can be measured through surveys or
through semi-structured interviews or routine

measurement depending on the indicators chosen. Some of these measures may be integrated
into the data collection plan of the QI project
without the need for additional work. For most
QI projects, a simple survey with a few questions might suffice. But if more rigor is needed,
validated survey instruments exist for these outcomes (Weiner et al., 2017; Roberts, Becker, &
Seay, 1997). Fidelity can be measured through
observations of adherence (Carroll et al., 2007)
to a practice or protocol using checklists (Breitenstein et al., 2010). Cost and reach can be
measured through reviews of operational documents (e.g., admissions registers or accounting records). Lewis and colleagues (Lewis et al.,
2015) identified 104 instruments for measuring
one or more implementation outcomes.
BOX 3.1 illustrates the use of implementation outcomes in improvement work at a hypothetical hospital. “Mercy Hospital” is a tertiary
hospital with a mature QI program. They have

Integrating Implementation into QI: The Model for Improvement and Implementation

BOX 3.1 Implementing an Evidence-Based Communication Protocol, Part 1
The QI team at Mercy Hospital seeks to increase average patient satisfaction by 25% through an
improvement change package involving an evidence-based provider/patient communication
protocol that has been shown to work in controlled experiments. To ensure that they can successfully
implement the change package at Mercy, they talk to key stakeholders (leadership, physicians, nurses)
in the facility to determine the barriers to implementation. Based on these conversations, the team
determines that the greatest barrier to implementation of this protocol is provider acceptability and
selects acceptability as the implementation outcome of interest. An acceptability survey administered
to providers indicates that currently, only 25% of the providers consider the protocol “highly
acceptable.” The team determines that at least 75% of the providers will need to find the protocol
acceptable to ensure successful implementation. This is a necessary precursor to realizing the desired
patient outcomes—in this case, patient satisfaction.

been very successful at initiating QI projects,
but have had trouble making them stick in
their organization. Guided by implementation
scientists, Mercy Hospital QI teams are beginning to use the MFII to improve their quality
of implementation. The evidence-based communication protocol is their first project to use
the enhanced model.

Implementation Determinants
The second implementation question in the
MFII asks, What are the factors that facilitate
and impede the achievement of the implementation aim? These are referred to as implementation determinants in the implementation
science literature. In a comprehensive review
of the literature, Durlak and Dupre (2008)
identified 23 contextual factors that affect
implementation. A partial listing, from Durlak
(Durlak & DuPre, 2008), is shown in TABLE 3.2.
As shown in Table 3.2, the factors affecting implementation can depend on a variety
of characteristics such as the practitioner,
the process, the organization, the program
and the environment. Sorting through these
and identifying the factors that are most
relevant for a specific QI program in a specific context could be a formidable task.
Implementation researchers have developed
a variety of frameworks that facilitate a systematic approach. Nilsen (2015) identified 13

“determinant” frameworks in which the “aim
is to understand and/or explain influences on
implementation outcomes, e.g., predicting
outcomes or interpreting outcomes retrospectively.” One of the most widely accepted
of these is the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research (Damschroder
et al., 2009), commonly referred to as CFIR.
The framework has been tested widely in
many different contexts. A systematic review
identified 26 studies that have used the framework (Kirk et al., 2016).
FIGURE 3.7 shows the graphic of the framework, which consists of 39 factors affecting
implementation organized by five domains
that are similar to those described in Table 3.2.
Definitions of each of the factors are provided
in APPENDIX 3.1. Extensive documentation to
support the use of the framework by practitioners and researchers is available at the CFIR
website. To explore how CFIR can be used to
identify factors that affect implementation
outcomes, BOX 3.2 returns to the hypothetical
example of implementing provider/patient
communication protocols described earlier.
CFIR was developed to assist implementation researchers, though it is also a useful
framework for practitioners. Another set
of frameworks oriented primarily toward
practitioners is the five Active Implementation Frameworks (AIF) (Metz & Bartley,
2012; Blanchard et al., 2017) created by the

BOX 3.2 Implementing an Evidence-Based Communication Protocol, Part 2
Recall that the implementation outcome of interest at Mercy Hospital was the acceptability of the
communication protocol to providers. The CFIR domains provide a systematic way of identifying
the most important barriers to acceptability. Reviewing the results from the staff survey, the team
determines that the individuals involved and the inner setting (i.e., organizational characteristics) are
the most important determinants affecting the acceptability of the protocol. These include service
provider knowledge regarding the communication protocol, their beliefs about their ability to
implement it, and organizational attitudes towards change. To get a deeper understanding or
these determinants, the team may conduct additional interviews with the staff and leadership
of the facilities or use questionnaires to measure organizational readiness for change. Simple,
locally developed questionnaires might suffice, but for those requiring rigor, several validated
instruments such as the Acceptance of Change Scale (ACS) to measure individual attitudes (Di Fabio &
Gori, 2016), or the Organizational Readiness to Implement Change (ORIC) instrument (Shea,
Jacobs, Esserman, Bruce, & Weiner, 2014) to assess organizational motivation and capacity for
implementation are available in the literature.

National Implementation Research Network
(NIRN). Together, these frameworks address
all the components needed to realize outcomes through the successful implementation
of interventions. The five frameworks are:
(1) Usable interventions, defining the characteristics of interventions that are most suitable for implementation; (2) implementation
stages, reflecting the process needed to plan
and execute implementation of an intervention; (3) implementation drivers, which are
defined as “key components of capacity and
infrastructure that influence a program’s success” (Metz & Bartley, 2012); (4) implementation teams to support the implementation;
and (5) improvement cycles to ensure that
the implementation is adapted to local contexts. The frameworks and their definitions
are shown in FIGURE 3.8. As with the CFIR,
extensive resources, training modules, and
tools describing the use of these frameworks
are available on the NIRN website.
Among the five AIFs, the implementation drivers (Bertram et al., 2015) are
most directly related to the factors affecting implementation. The drivers are shown
in FIGURE 3.9 and are categorized into competencies (hiring, training, and support
needed to ensure that staff are well equipped

to implement), leadership (ensuring that
leaders have both the management skills and
the ability to adapt to changing implementation environments) and organization (use
of data to drive decisions, organizational
support for change, and integration of the
implementation with other external policy and resource priorities). These drivers
can be mapped on to the CFIR components
of inner setting, outer setting, individuals
involved and the implementation process.

Implementation Strategies
The third implementation question of the
MFII—What implementation strategies can
we use to improve implementation of the chosen
intervention?—addresses the actions that a QI
team needs to take to enhance the implementation quality of the QI intervention. Implementation strategies are defined as “methods
or techniques used to enhance the adoption,
implementation, and sustainability” (Powell
et al., 2015). Powell and his colleagues used an
expert consensus building process to identify
73 discrete implementation strategies that are
typically used for implementing program and
practices (shown in APPENDIX 3.2). In a further study, these strategies were aggregated

BOX 3.3 Implementing an Evidence-Based Communication Protocol, Part 3
Recall that the most relevant implementation outcome was acceptability of the protocol and that
surveys and interviews conducted by the QI team identified the individuals involved and the inner
settings as the CFIR domains of interest. Based on Table 3.4 and 3.5, the QI team may select developing
stakeholder interrelationships, training and educating stakeholders, and some financial incentives or
disincentives as categories from which to create a collection of implementation strategies. From
Appendix 3.3, the team may select applicable detailed strategies.
TABLE 3.6 shows the strategy categories and the detailed strategies that may be used as defined in
Powell (2015).
As shown in Figure 3.4, the selected implementation strategies are tested, refined, and tailored for
to the implementation context using PDSA cycles. The third column of Table 3.6 describes how this

Implementing Well:

Even the best implementation strategies will
not be of use unless they are implemented
well. Several frameworks for guiding the

implementation process exist in the implementation science literature. We will describe
two that are useful to practitioners: Stages
of Implementation, which is one of the
AIFs described earlier, and the Interactive
Systems Framework for Dissemination and
Implementation.
The NIRN stages of implementation

which the implementation of an intervention
takes place (Bertram et al., 2015). The stages are
shown in FIGURE 3.10. The Exploration Stage
overlaps with some of the planning activities
mentioned previously to assess organizational
readiness for implementation, identify key
factors affecting implementation, and develop
implementation strategies. During the Installation Stage, resources for carrying out the
implementation strategies are acquired, both
for the actual implementation itself and for any
technical support that may be required. Training of staff may also take place at this stage.
The Initial Implementation is where the intervention is implemented for the first time, using
the implementation strategies. The strategies
themselves may be tested and adapted during
this stage, and any changes to the intervention
may be considered. During Full Implementation, ongoing testing and refinement may
take place, but the intervention begins to get
embedded in the organization and becomes
part of everyday work.
It is important to understand that while
the stages are represented as a linear progression, in reality this is a nonlinear process. The stages overlap with each other, and

there may be situations where there may be
the need to cycle back to earlier stages based
on the results of tests of strategies (e.g., if it is
apparent during initial implementation that
staff have not been trained adequately or are
not motivated, it may be necessary to go back
to some of the installation and exploration
activities of staff preparation and readiness
building).
The Interactive Systems Framework (Wandersman et al., 2008; Scaccia et al., 2015) shown
in FIGURE 3.11 conceptualizes implementation
occurring through interactions between three
systems: the synthesis and translation system,
the support system, and the delivery system.
The synthesis and translation system adapts an
intervention (or an implementation strategy)
and tailors (translates) it to fit the local context.
The support system provides training, coaching, tools, and technical assistance needed for
implementation. The delivery system is where
the work gets done. According to the framework, successful implementation requires
an appropriate implementation strategy, and
motivation and capacities to both support the
implementation and to deliver it in practice.
The framework distinguishes between general

capacities and innovation-specific capacities.
The former relate to overall organizational
capabilities and include factors such as leadership, adequate resources, organizational
readiness to change and innovate, and effective processes for support and delivery that are
needed for the successful implementation of
any intervention. The latter refer to knowledge,
skills and abilities and organizational support that are unique to the intervention itself.
For example, in the case of a hand-hygiene
intervention, this could be knowledge about
hand-washing techniques and organizational
support for a hand-hygiene program.
How can these frameworks be used in practice to improve the quality of implementation
of a QI intervention? As described by Leeman
et al. (2017), a collection of selected implementation strategies such as the one shown in Table
3.6 is nothing more than a list until the strategies can be embedded in the implementation

process. For implementation to be successful,
different strategies need to be used at different
implementation stages and in different systems,
and the frameworks provide guidance on how
to do this. Let’s return to the example of the
communication protocol (BOX 3.4). We show
how the two frameworks described above can
be used to develop an implementation plan
based on the strategies in Table 3.6. TABLE 3.7
shows the strategies from Table 3.6 organized
by implementation stage. TABLE 3.8 shows how
the Interactive Systems Framework (ISF) may
be used for implementation planning.

Conclusions

The purpose of this chapter is to introduce
quality improvement practitioners to some

BOX 3.4 Implementing an Evidence-Based Communication Protocol, Part 4
Using the Stages of Implementation Framework (Table 3.7): In the exploration stage, the QI team
continues to identify factors that might affect the quality of implementation and develops a package
of strategies. In the installation stage, the team may begin conversations with early adopters who
might serve as champions, and test and refine the messages that these champions should disseminate
to other service providers. Once the messages have been finalized, the team may test the different
methods for dissemination (e.g., face-to-face presentations at staff meetings, informational flyers, video
presentations, and so forth). As more departments begin to use the protocol, the champions and other
staff members involved in the implementation may organize local seminars and workshops where staff
can share their experiences about the implementation process. Over time, as the protocol becomes
part of everyday use, staff leaders in various departments may monitor its use and continue to provide
support for implementation as required and training as new providers enter the system.
Using the Interactive Systems Framework: We can also use the Interactive Systems Framework
to develop an implementation plan for the strategies in Table 3.6. The ISF helps to ensure that all
aspects of the implementation are considered in a systematic way. As shown in Table 3.8, successful
implementation of the communication protocol requires testing and adaptation of the strategies to
ensure fit, (synthesis and translation system) requires hiring, training and utilizing leaders and champions
to support the intervention (support systems) and needs a method to ensure that staff is motivated to
use the protocol (delivery system). Both the Stages framework and the ISF present the same information
in slightly different ways and QI teams can select on or the other, or both depending on their needs.

is and how it has been developed. As a result,
improvement interventions are often poorly
implemented, and implementation science
has failed to benefit from the wealth of practical knowledge about theories of systems,

processes, and variation that are cornerstones
of good QI practice. The intent of this chapter
is to bridge this gap. QI practitioners, armed
with implementation science tools will be well
equipped to realize the old adage: “What is
worth doing is worth doing well.”

List of Behavioral Change
Techniques
No.

Label

Definition

Examples

1. Goals and planning
1.1

Goal setting
(behavior)

Set or agree on a goal defined in
terms of the behavior to be achieved.
Note: only code goal-setting if there
is sufficient evidence that goal set as
part of intervention; if goal unspecified
or a behavioral outcome, code 1.3,
Goal setting (outcome); if the goal
defines a specific context, frequency,
duration or intensity for the behavior,
also code 1.4, Action planning.

Agree on a daily walking
goal (e.g., 3 miles) with
the person and reach
agreement about the goal.
Set the goal of eating
5 pieces of fruit per day
as specified in public
health guidelines.

1.2

Problem solving

Analyze, or prompt the person to
analyze, factors influencing the
behavior and generate or select
strategies that include overcoming
barriers and/or increasing facilitators
(includes Relapse Prevention and
Coping Planning).

Identify specific triggers
(e.g., being in a pub,
feeling anxious) that
generate the urge/want/
need to drink and develop
strategies for avoiding
environmental triggers
or for managing negative
emotions, such as anxiety,
that motivate drinking.

82

Appendix 3.4 List of Behavioral Change Techniques

83

Note: barrier identification without
solutions is not sufficient. If the BCT
does not include analyzing the
behavioral problem, consider 12.3,
Avoidance/changing exposure
to cues for the behavior, 12.1,
Restructuring the physical
environment, 12.2, Restructuring
the social environment, or 11.2,
Reduce negative emotions

Prompt the patient to
identify barriers preventing
them from starting a new
exercise regimen (e.g., lack
of motivation), and discuss
ways in which they could
help overcome them (e.g.,
going to the gym with a
buddy).

1.3

Goal setting
(outcome)

Set or agree on a goal defined in
terms of a positive outcome of
wanted behavior.
Note: only code guidelines if set as a
goal in an intervention context; if goal
is a behavior, code 1.1, Goal setting
(behavior); if goal unspecified, code
1.3, Goal setting (outcome).

Set a weight loss goal
(e.g., 0.5 kilogram over one
week) as an outcome of
changed eating patterns.

1.4

Action planning

Prompt detailed planning of
performance of the behavior (must
include at least one of context,
frequency, duration and intensity).
Context may be environmental
(physical or social) or internal (physical,
emotional or cognitive) (includes
Implementation Intentions).
Note: evidence of action planning
does not necessarily imply goal setting,
only code latter if sufficient evidence.

Encourage a plan to carry
condoms when going out
socially at weekends.
Prompt planning the
performance of a particular
physical activity (e.g.,
running) at a particular
time (e.g., before work) on
certain days of the week.

1.5

Review
behavior goal(s)

Review behavior goal(s) jointly with
the person and consider modifying
goal(s) or behavior change strategy
in light of achievement. This may
lead to re-setting the same goal, a
small change in that goal or setting
a new goal instead of (or in addition
to) the first, or no change.
Note: if goal specified in terms of
behavior, code 1.5, Review behavior
goal(s), if goal unspecified, code
1.7, Review outcome goal(s); if
discrepancy created consider also
1.6, Discrepancy between current
behavior and goal.

Examine how well a
person’s performance
corresponds to agreed
goals (e.g., whether they
consumed less than one
unit of alcohol per day),
and consider modifying
future behavioral goals
accordingly (e.g., by
increasing or decreasing
alcohol target or changing
type of alcohol consumed).

Discrepancy
between current
behavior and
goal

Draw attention to discrepancies
between a person’s current
behavior (in terms of the form,
frequency, duration, or intensity of

behavior).
Note: if discomfort is created only
code 13.3, Incompatible beliefs
and not 1.6, Discrepancy between
current behavior and goal; if goals
are modified, also code 1.5, Review
behavior goal(s) and/or 1.7,

is provided, also code 2.2, Feedback
on behavior.

Point out that the recorded
exercise fell short of the
goal set.

1.7

Review outcome
goal(s)

Review outcome goal(s) jointly with
the person and consider modifying
goal(s) in light of achievement. This
may lead to re-setting the same goal,
a small change in that goal or setting
a new goal instead of, or in addition
to the first.
Note: if goal specified in terms of
behavior, code 1.5, Review behavior
goal(s), if goal unspecified, code
1.7, Review outcome goal(s); if
discrepancy created consider also

behavior to be performed, agreed
on by the person, and witnessed by
another
Note: also code 1.1, Goal
setting (behavior).

person (e.g., specifying that
they will not drink alcohol
for 1 week).

CHAPTER 4

Understanding Variation,
Tools, and Data Sources for
CQI in Health Care
William A. Sollecito and David Hardison
Information is random and miscellaneous, but
knowledge is orderly and cumulative.
—Daniel Boorstin

C

ontinuous quality improvement (CQI)
requires knowledge about the behavior
of systems and processes, which is most
often obtained from data and other sources of
information collected for that specific purpose
and through the application of tools and techniques that have proven to be effective throughout the evolution of CQI as described earlier in
this text. The use of data and tools is part of the
concept of statistical thinking, which is a key
component of both the philosophy and processes of CQI. Central to decisions about innovations and especially CQI in health care is the
need to improve our knowledge about health
care process performance through an understanding of the context in which processes
behave, asking the right questions, and then
the collecting and analyzing appropriate data.

The goal is not simply to analyze data, but to
gain knowledge by utilizing data to understand
processes, sources of variation, and the impact
of improvements. Most important in CQI
applications is the requirement to understand
variability and the predictability of health care
processes. As described in Chapters 1 and 2,
CQI requires a systems approach that analyzes assumptions and focuses on customers/
patients, processes, and interdependencies
based on knowledge. This approach is most
efficiently accomplished using stepwise, yet
cyclical, procedures that span planning, implementation, and an assessment of the impact of
the decisions made in identifying and applying
changes—including how to determine when
a change is needed and whether it leads to an
improvement (Langley et al., 2009). Although
many different methods can be applied to
carry out these steps, CQI efforts in the past
have spawned methods that have proven to be
robust and efficient when focused on listening to the “voice of the process” underpinned
107

108

Chapter 4 Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care

with an understanding of variation (Wheeler &
Chambers, 2010). These methods include
a continuous assessment of process performance, including an understanding of sources
of variation, followed by decision making based
on the application of knowledge about systems
and measurements. Over the years, a set of
tools have been developed to carry out these
steps in the most efficient manner; as with CQI
itself, these tools have undergone a continuous improvement process that enhances our
learning about how to apply them, and when
to introduce new tools. Especially in health
care, which itself has undergone an evolutionary process rooted in new knowledge and the
greater use of technology, new tools and data
sources have been developed to ensure that the
“Quadruple Aim” of health care—improving
the experience of care, improving the health of
populations, and reducing the per capita costs
of health care while improving the work life of
clinicians and health care staff (discussed in
Chapter 2)—has been met (Bodenheimer &
Sinsky, 2014; Sikka, Morath, & Leape, 2015).
At the heart of these procedures is the use
of evidence-based approaches that rely on
health information technology that provides
high-quality data to ensure that correct decisions are made in the efficient application of
the “data-to-decision cycle” (McLaughlin &
Kibbe, 2013). The greater use of technology to
collect and analyze health care data presents
greater opportunities for both converting data
into information or knowledge and applying
powerful methodologies for implementing
improvement, but it also presents challenges to
ensure the most appropriate application of tools
and techniques to carry out CQI initiatives.
Many valuable texts are available that
explain the mechanics of CQI analysis methods and tools (e.g., Balestracci, 2009; Bialek,
Duffy, & Moran, 2009; Carey & Lloyd, 2001;
Langley et al., 2009; Lighter & Fair, 2004; Lloyd,
2019; Streibel, Sholtes, & Joiner, 2003). This
chapter will not duplicate the information
provided in those texts. Rather, the purpose
of this chapter is to assist in understanding

the role of variation in quality improvement,
why measurement and statistical thinking are
vital to quality improvement efforts, and to
illustrate a few fundamental CQI tools that are
particularly useful in health care to enhance
our learning about process changes and facilitate improvement in health care processes.
A minimum, but sufficient amount of detail,
with relevant examples, will be provided to
enhance understanding and enable the reader
to develop and apply these tools. Finally,
the chapter presents a brief overview of the
strengths and weaknesses of various forms of
health information data sources that are currently being used to carry out CQI initiatives.

Health Care Systems
and Processes

The early work of Donabedian is foundational
in understanding health care systems and processes (Donabedian, 1980). He described the
process of care as a system involving three components: structure, process and outcomes that
comprise a set of activities requiring interaction
between patients and providers. More recently,
there has been greater attention paid to patient
centered care and the Donabedian model has
been expanded to include greater emphasis on
the patient experience (Spath & Kelly, 2017).
This is reflected to some degree in the greater
emphasis on patient satisfaction data and its role
in measuring quality of care; this source of data
and information has strengths and weaknesses
in CQI, which will be discussed in greater detail
later in this chapter. The main emphasis of this
section is the central role of concepts such
as the Donabedian Model in understanding
health care processes and outcomes.

To understand the expected output of a process relative to a particular outcome or quality characteristic, or process capability, the

Health Care Systems and Processes

process must be stable, and, hence, predictable within limits. Benefits of a stable process
(Deming, 1986) include:
■

■
■
■

The process has an identity (capability); it
is predictable. Therefore, there is a rational basis for planning.
Costs and quality are predictable.
Productivity is at a maximum and costs at
a minimum under the present system.
The effect of changes in the process can be
assessed with greater speed and reliability. In an unstable process, it is difficult
to separate changes to the process from
special causes of variation. Therefore, it
is more difficult to know when a change
results in improvement.

Interpreting Process
Requirements and Performance
Variation exists in every process and always
will. It is the manager’s job to understand variation and continuously improve the processes
so that they manage to meet the needs of the
customers who depend upon their processes.
The customer of each process has requirements
which specify the level of performance that is
needed. A provider working in the emergency
department (ED) would require more rapid
turnaround time (TAT) of laboratory results
than a provider working in a primary care
office. A 30-minute TAT in the ED may be
unacceptable, whereas a 24-hour TAT may be
acceptable for a primary care office. There may
also be specific requirements for analyzing the
laboratory specimen. Technology used for one
type of test may require 30 minutes to be processed, while a different type of test can be completed within seconds. Customer and technical
requirements must both be taken into account
in order to interpret whether the performance
of the process is acceptable or whether the process needs to be improved. That said, every
process can be improved in the spirit of CQI.
Process requirements may be thought of
as the criteria from which the effectiveness

109

of a process may be evaluated from the process customer’s perspective. They function as
both inputs to designing a process and outputs
from executing a process. It is essential to first
identify the customers of a process. Chapter
7 provides an in-depth discussion of customers of health care organizations (i.e., the role
of patients in CQI). Brief definitions, using
a systems perspective, are provided here. A
customer is defined as anyone who has expectations regarding a process operation or outputs. In health care delivery organizations,
the primary customer is the patient, while the
community may be the primary customer for
a public health agency. Internal customers are
those within the organizations and are sometimes thought of as those departments or
coworkers “downstream” from the process. In
other words, who the customers of a process
are depends on the outputs of a process. For
example, the recovery room or postanesthesia
care unit may be thought of as the customer of
the operating room. Patient care units may be
thought of as customers of diagnostic departments (e.g., laboratory, radiology). Payers may
be considered as external customers—those
outside the provider organization. A stakeholder is anyone with an interest in or affected
by the work you do. Regulatory bodies such as
The Joint Commission (TJC), formerly known
as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations, or the National
Commission on Quality Assurance (NCQA)
would be considered stakeholders for hospitals
and health insurance companies, respectively.
Professional societies that define practice standards may also be thought of as stakeholders.
The market refers to the environment in which
you operate and do business and may include
socioeconomic, demographic, geographic, and
competitive considerations.
Once customers, stakeholders, and markets have been identified, it is essential to
identify and understand what they require
of your services. For example, patients may
require access and competent, courteous providers; payers may require a certain level of

110

Chapter 4 Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care

clinical results delivered in a cost-effective
manner; regulatory bodies require compliance;
and markets may require a culturally diverse
approach to delivering services.
These requirements are vital to determining what services are needed and how the processes comprising the services are designed and
improved. These requirements also provide the
basis for selecting variables or attributes that
will measure the process performance from the
perspective of the customer.
TABLE 4.1 illustrates how one health-services
organization operationalizes the links between
customer requirements, process design, measurement, and goals.
TABLE 4.2 illustrates the core processes for
each phase of the continuum of inpatient care.
The patients’ interface with this organization
follows the following path:
Admission → Assessment → Care Delivery/
Treatment → Discharge

The core process(es) for each phase of
care are shown in the first column. The second column lists the key requirements for the
process, derived from a variety of methods targeted toward understanding requirements of
patients, internal customers, stakeholders, and
the market in which the organization operates.
The third column lists the attributes or variables
that the organization measures to understand
the degree to which its processes are meeting
stakeholder requirements.
It is management’s job to ensure that the
process requirements (also referred to as the
Voice of the Customer) and the process performance (also referred to as the Voice of the Process) are aligned (Carey & Lloyd, 2001; Wheeler,
2000; Wheeler & Chambers, 2010). If the two
are not in alignment, then the process must
be improved. The analysis of process performance must be based upon knowledge of the
sources of variation in the process (i.e., common and special causes). This process analysis

Chapter 4 Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care

which will be described in detail later in this
chapter, is accomplished by collecting data on
process outcomes, plotting that data over time,
constructing process behavior (also known as
control) charts, and interpreting them based
upon an understanding of variation. This is
essentially converting those data into information and knowledge (Ross, 2014). Other considerations, to be discussed later in this chapter,
include choosing the optimal sources of data
with consideration of data quality and choosing appropriate tools and techniques that are
useful for carrying out these analyses.
Each of these methods has a common
approach to be successful in analyzing process performance; that is the need for careful measurement and an understanding of
sources of variation, which will be covered in
the next sections.

▸

Gaining Knowledge
Through Measurement

In order to convert data into knowledge and
make appropriate decisions about process
improvements, critical and statistical thinking is required. This sounds very simple, but
in our modern age of high-speed computing, it
is all too easy to apply statistical methods and
focus on results without the necessary step of
thinking critically and understanding what our
data tell us about the system we are trying to
improve. This point was emphasized in 1996 by
Dr. Donald Berwick, among others, when he
noted that “measurement is only a handmaiden
to improvement, but improvement cannot
act without it. We speak here not of measurement for the purpose of judgment (for deciding whether or not to buy, accept, or reject or
who to blame) but for the purpose of learning”
(Berwick, 1996, p. 621). Not only is this view
consistent with the guidelines for improvement spelled out in the earliest applications of
CQI—for example, by W. Edwards Deming in
his well-known 14 points (1986)—this view is

also well understood and espoused in recent
statistical literature (Balestracci, 2009; Langley et al., 2009). With this cautionary note in
mind, we will address the important concept of
understanding process variation.

The Critical Role of
Understanding Variation
It has long been established that a starting
point for any quality improvement effort is
understanding variation (Deming, 1986, 1993;
Nolan & Provost, 1990; Nolan, Perla, & Provost, 2016; Wheeler, 2000; Wheeler & Chambers, 2010). It was Shewhart’s idea (1931) that
statistically controlled variation of processes
(also called statistical process control) is the
foundation of all empirical CQI activities.
In fact, listening to the voice of the process
with knowledge of variation will lead to the
appropriate actions to take for improvement
and is fundamental to CQI (Deming, 1986,
1993; Nolan, Perla, & Provost, 2016; Nolan &
Provost, 1990; Wheeler, 2000; Wheeler &
Chambers, 2010).
One of the key elements of the system of
profound knowledge proposed by Deming
(1993) is knowledge about variation and how it
interacts with other elements of knowledge to
lead to a transformation based on CQI. As quality improvement has evolved over the years from
business applications to health care, the concepts related to understanding variation have
also been applied specifically to health care with
many examples and how the action required
for improvement is dependent on this understanding (Carey & Lloyd, 2001; McLaughlin &
Kaluzny, 2006; Nelson, Splaine, Batalden, &
Plume, 1998).
This section introduces the general concept of variation, discusses variation in relation to processes, and begins to describe why
measurement and appropriate analysis are
vital to guiding actions for improvement. Its
emphasis is on health care applications, with
numerous examples presented.

Gaining Knowledge Through Measurement

Variation: What Is It and Why
Study It?
Variation is everywhere—a diabetic’s glucose
level, the waiting time in a physician’s office,
blood pressure, the balance of trade, the behavior of people, the incidence of cancer, and
the price of eggs all vary over time. In order
to understand variation, two definitions are
important. Common causes of variation are the
causes and conditions inherently present that
impact every outcome of a process. Special
causes of variation are not a part of the process
all of the time and do not affect every outcome
but arise because of specific circumstances
(Deming, 1986). For the sake of completeness and clarity, it should also be noted that
some authors refer to these two causes in process analysis as noise and signals, respectively
(Wheeler, 2000). The appropriate action for
improvement depends upon the correct interpretation of patterns in the variation observed.
Is the variation random and attributable to the
materials, methods, environment, people, etc.
that are common to every outcome, or was there
a signal of a trend or another discernable pattern in the data indicating that a special cause
is present in the process? As will be described
shortly in our discussion of process behavior
charts, variation in a process over time can be
measured, analyzed, and displayed in a manner
that helps to distinguish its source (i.e., special
vs. common cause). The importance of understanding this classification of causes directly
relates to predictability of the outcomes of a
process, and where special causes of variation
are detected, outcomes are not predictable with
any reasonable degree of belief (Deming, 1986;
Langley et al., 2009; Shewhart, 1931; Wheeler,
2000; Wheeler & Chambers, 2010). This is of
critical importance in health care.
Berwick (1991) describes the role of variation and predictability in processes carried out
daily in health care organizations:
Those who prepare [patients] for
[cardiac] surgery rely . . . upon the

113

predictability of the systems . . . that
affect [their] care and outcome. The
surgeon knows that coagulation test
reports will be returned within 20
and 25 minutes of their being sent;
the anesthesiologist knows that blood
gas values will be back in 4 to 8 minutes; the pump technician knows that
tubing connections will tolerate pressures within a certain range. Each
makes plans in accordance with those
predictions, and each bases those predictions on prior experience, which
is judged to be informative. Sudden,
unpredicted variation is experienced
as trouble. (p. 1217)
From the national, organizational, or
individual perspective, one cannot escape
the role and influence of variation on health
care quality (Gold, 2004). Understanding
causes of variation and using that knowledge
to determine when and how to make process
improvements involves the use of tools and
procedures designed for these purposes. A
key point to remember is that these tools can
be used together in a complementary cyclical manner to identify the need for process
improvement, decide on what improvements
are needed, measure the impact of those
changes and assess what further improvements are needed. For example, the use of
process behavior charts may lead to the identification of special causes of variation, which
will require process improvement; the determination of specific steps needed to make
improvements can be accomplished through
involvement of team members in a brainstorming exercise or other analyses to identify process changes, and implementation
and measurement of the impact of changes
will require methods such as the PDSA cycle
described throughout this text; then followed
by use of process behavior charts to assess
the need for further improvements and this
improvement cycle will then be repeated
(Langley et al., 2009).

Chapter 4 Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care

Nature of Process Variation and
Actions for Improvement
A couple of other definitions are important
to help clarify why understanding variation is
vital to CQI. A process is said to be stable and
“in statistical control” if only common causes
are affecting the outcomes over time. This does
not mean that the outcomes are good or bad
or that there is no variation. It means that the
outcomes are predictable within statistically
determined limits. Similarly, an unstable process is a process in which outcomes are affected
by both common and special causes, and the
outcomes are unpredictable. The appropriate
actions for improvement of a process depend
upon whether the process is stable or unstable.
If the process is unstable, then variation is produced by both common and special causes so
the appropriate action for improvement is to
investigate and prevent the special causes from
happening again. Once the process is stable,
then the appropriate action for improvement
is to make a change which reduces or removes
some of the common causes. Luckily, Shewhart
(1931) provided a method to operationally
define a stable process using a control chart.

Control Charts/Process
Behavior Charts
The control chart, which is often described
as one of many CQI tools (Bialek, Duffy, &
Moran, 2009; Langley et al., 2009) is arguably
the most important since it represents a powerful methodology for explaining concepts
of process variation. It was first developed by
Shewhart as a methodology for analyzing and
understanding process variability and predictability (Shewhart, 1931; Wheeler, 2000,
Wheeler & Chambers, 2010). In the evolution of CQI that was described in Chapter 1,
this “tool” has been found to be very useful in
many settings and has been called by several
names, including Shewhart control charts and
most recently, process behavior charts, which

is derived from its broad use as a descriptor of
process variability. We will use control chart
and process behavior chart interchangeably
throughout this chapter and this text.
A control chart is a plot of process measurements over time overlaid by three statistically computed lines: a center line, an upper
control limit, and a lower control limit. The
vertical axis of a control chart represents the
actual value of the measure we are studying to
assess process performance and variability; the
horizontal axis represents the time scale over
which we have collected process measures. One
important goal of a control chart is to display
individual process data in a time series, which
is much more useful than simply analyzing
measures of central tendency alone (e.g., an
arithmetic average), when carrying out a process behavior analysis in CQI. In this way, a
control chart illustrates and concentrates on the
behavior of the underlying process. The upper
and lower control limits of a process behavior
chart define the Natural Process Limits (i.e.,
what the process will deliver as long as it continues to operate as consistently as possible),
thus describing what Wheeler (2000) defines as
the voice of the process. While the Run Chart,
which will be described later in this chapter, is
also an extremely useful CQI tool for displaying
time series summaries of process measures, the
control chart has one very important unique
capability and purpose: it is the most powerful tool for distinguishing between common
and special causes of variation and predicting
future performance of a stable process within
a range (Langley et al., 2009). Further increasing the usefulness of this tool, but also adding
some level of confusion, especially to novices
in CQI, is that there have been many types of
control charts described in the CQI literature
over many years. These differ according to their
application to various types of data with different measurement scales (Langley et al., 2009):
1.
2.

Classification data/nominal data:
p chart or np chart
Count data: c chart or u chart

Gaining Knowledge Through Measurement

Dimension Measured

Other differences among these charts
relate to the number of observations per time
point; for example, for continuous data, the
Xbar chart is useful when there are multiple
observations per time point and individual,
or XmR charts are used when there is one
observation per time point. Before describing
details about how to produce control charts,
it is useful to review the interpretive concepts
that are common to all forms of control charts.
FIGURE 4.1 shows a series of X-bar charts,
including a solid center line (mean, i.e., arithmetic average) and two dashed lines, representing lower and upper control limits. These three
charts illustrate the following: Segment (A) represents a situation when the data are considered
to be stable; the points do not go outside of the
control limits and there are no discernable patterns within the limits. This process will continue to produce predictable outcomes within
these limits as long as the conditions that produced all of these results continue. The latter is
a subject matter judgment, not a statistical one.
Improvement will come from changing the
process that impacts every output of the process (i.e., the common causes). In segment (B)
there are values outside the control limits; thus,
the process is unstable due to special causes of
variation. The appropriate action is to investigate the special causes and determine how to
remove them. Finally, segment (C) describes
the situation when there is a discernable pattern
within the control limits. In this case, there are
too many values in a row below the center line.
The exact definition of how many is too many
varies by several factors, including sample size
and number of time points. These are discussed
by several authors along with other rules that
define patterns which may signal special cause
variation (Balestracci, 2009; Perla, Provost, &
Murray, 2011; Wheeler, 2000).
In addition to measuring process behavior to determine common vs. special causes

of variation, control charts are also used to
assess the impact of an improvement effort by
continuing to plot the process outcomes after
a change is made to the process. The change
should show up as a special cause signal in the
chart and should settle down to a new center
line over time unless unplanned special causes

116

Chapter 4 Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care

impact the process. The process should continue to be monitored and the same diagnostics and actions for improvement as described
previously should be employed.

XmR Charts
“Individual values” charts, also called XmR
charts, have proven to be the very useful in
health care and have the advantage of being
“non-parametric,” thereby being applicable to a
multiple types of measurement scales. Wheeler
points out that when measurements are based
on counts or percentages and data are displayed
in p charts, for example, assumptions are necessary about the specific probability models
(e.g., binomial or Poisson) in order to compute
theoretical limits; however, XmR charts are
based on empirical limits and no assumptions
are needed (Wheeler, 2000, p. 140).
XmR charts are actually two charts: (1) a
plot of the individual process outcomes, or X
values, over time; and (2) a plot of the absolute differences from one X to the next X over
time, or the Moving Ranges—designated mR
(Wheeler, 2000). The center line of the X chart
is typically the average (mean) of the individual X values and the Upper Control Limit or
UCL is the average(of X values) +2.66 times
the average of the Moving Ranges. The Lower
Control Limit or LCL is the average(of X values) −2.66 times the average of the Moving

Ranges. Similarly, the center line of the mR
chart is the average of the Moving Ranges and
the UCL is 3.27 times the average mR. There
is no LCL for the mR chart since the absolute
values are used. There are times when one or
more data points or Moving Ranges are much
larger than others and would skew the average lines unduly. In these cases, it will be more
appropriate to use the median of the X values
and the median of the mR versus the average
(mean) X and average (mean) mR, respectively.
When this is done, the statistical scaling factors
have to be changed. The value of 2.66 changes
to 3.14, and the value of 3.27 changes to 3.87.
Process behavior charts are powerful tools
to provide knowledge and help you understand
variation in a process. “Points outside the limits
are signals – they are opportunities to discover
how to improve a process…and ask the right
questions” (Wheeler, 2000, p. 59). Wheeler
also notes that “if you are not pleased with the
amount of variation shown by the Natural Process Limits, you must go to work on the system
to change the underlying process, rather than
setting arbitrary goals, jawboning the workers,
or looking for alternative ways of computing
limits” (2000, p. 44). This is accomplished in various ways, including using other CQI tools, such
as those presented later in the chapter, e.g., construct a cause-and-effect diagram with a team of
people who work in the process to understand
the sources of common cause variation.

PROCESS BEHAVIOR CASE STUDY
In order to illustrate the construction and use of a process behavior chart, in particular an XmR chart,
the following hypothetical case study is presented.
University hospital, a large academic teaching hospital, has been undergoing expansion
throughout its state. As part of its goal to increase access to quality care in rural areas it has opened
a new primary care facility in a rural part of the state. This initiative included transferring well trained,
experienced clinical staff as well as hiring/training local staff in administrative roles. Because of her
experience in providing quality care and CQI, the new administrator of the rural clinic decided that
several measures of quality of care needed to be collected at the initiation of the clinic. Some questions
that needed to be answered are as follows (these are provided for readers to consider in their own
health care environment):

Gaining Knowledge Through Measurement

117

1. What would be some examples of process measures to collect?
2. How to effectively analyze these measures to understand what the level of quality is?
3. How to decide if and when changes in processes are needed?
4. What specific changes should be made and who decides?
5. How to determine if the changes made were improvements?
These are just a few examples of the kind of questions that should be asked in applying CQI in
this setting. We leave it up to readers of this chapter to discuss these questions and to think of others
that might be appropriate—especially after completing this chapter; but to illustrate process behavior
charts, we will focus on Questions 2 and 3.
To answer any of these questions data collection is required. A useful methodology, especially in
this setting when a new center is opening, is to collect daily measures and display them in a process
behavior chart. The experienced administrator knows that long waiting times really annoy patients and
are symptoms of inefficiency. She also knows that waiting times get increasingly worse throughout
the day if the clinic does not get off to a good start. Therefore, she wants the staff to track a simple but
important metric that she believes will play an important role in clinic quality and patient satisfaction:
Amount of time in minutes to prepare the clinic each morning for the arrival of patients. This metric
would not only measure clinic efficiency but could also have a direct impact on several other quality
measures, most notably waiting time and patient satisfaction. To answer questions 2 and 3 above the
administrator first met with the staff to operationally define how they would measure clinic preparation
time, including who would be responsible and when it would be measured each day. She planned
to have another meeting with the clinical staff after 2 weeks of data collection and teach them how
to display and interpret the data on a process behavior chart. Data were collected each day for the
first 2 weeks of operation; the clinic opened on Monday, June 5, 2017, and data were collected until
June 18, 2017. Preparation time (in minutes) is shown in TABLE 4.3A. The average (mean) amount of
time to prepare the clinic each day is approximately 16 minutes (16.3) and fluctuates between 13
and 22 minutes. Some might argue, “We prepared the clinic in 13 minutes on June 7. We should
figure out what we did and do it in 13 minutes every day!” This would actually make things worse and
unpredictable and would not reflect any understanding of variation. Similarly, asking why June 12 was
higher than the prior days would be equally counterproductive.
The optimal way to monitor and assess variation in the clinic preparation process is to use the
XmR chart described above. Wheeler (2000) describes reasons for using an XmR chart, which are
applicable to this example:
1. It contributes to knowledge about the process because it helps us to understand the right
questions to ask; to hear the “voice of the process.”
2. It is applicable when the data are collected over time and represent one data element (n = 1)
for each time point; in this case the data were continuous (interval scale) data: daily preparation
times measured (once a day) in minutes.
3. It allows us to study and learn from the variation in each pair of time points and adds substantial
knowledge about the process beyond just knowing the average and range of values.
4. Most important, it provides a methodology for understanding sources of variation and
separating “noise vs. signals”; it prevents us from taking unnecessary actions and helps us to
know when actions are needed to address special causes of variation.
The initial chart was established using the 14 data points in Table 4.3A and the associated process
behavior chart presented in FIGURE 4.2A.
Using the data presented in Table 4.3A, the first step in the construction of the XmR chart is to
compute the absolute value of the day to day differences in preparation time; for example, the

day 1 (19 minutes) minus day 2 value (15 minutes) leads to an absolute difference of 4 minutes.
Each pairwise difference, or moving range (mR), is computed and recorded; the average of the
moving ranges in Table 4.3A is 2.23 minutes. As noted above, the average of the individual (X) values
and the average of the moving ranges (mR) are needed to compute the upper (UCL) and lower (LCL)
control limits of this process behavior chart. (As described above the formula for the control limits
are: UCL = average of the individual X values +2.66 times the average of the Moving Ranges;
LCL = average of the individual X values −2.66 times the average of the Moving Range). Based on
these formulas the LCL is 10.4 and the UCL is 22.2 minutes.

FIGURE 4.2A Process Behavior Chart for Clinic Preparation Time: June 5–18
The chart in Figure 4.2A is the process behavior chart for the data displayed in Table 4.3A;
preparation times for the first 2 weeks of clinic operation. This chart reflects the voice of the process.
The fact that all of the first 2 weeks of preparation times are within the control limits of 10.4 and
22.2 minutes indicates that the process is stable, and the variability observed is due only to common
causes of variation. The process will continue to perform in this range unless a special cause occurs to
disrupt the process. If there is a signal of a special cause below the lower limit, the clinic team should
investigate and determine if the reason is repeatable or just a fluke. If it is repeatable and could be
incorporated into the process daily, then a process change should be planned and implemented
since this would represent a shortening of the daily preparation time—an improvement. If there is
a special cause signal above the upper limit, the team should also investigate and seek to prevent
the special cause from recurring. Lastly, a process that is operating within the control limits does not
mean that it should not be improved if it is not meeting the needs of the patient or other downstream
processes. It just means that the strategy for improvement will be different. The clinic team would seek
to understand the system of common causes and identify what can be changed that would impact
every occurrence of the process. This investigation may involve the use of some of the CQI tools that
we describe later in this chapter.
After teaching the team how to construct and interpret the initial chart, the administrator
explained how to maintain the chart on a daily basis. This simply required the person taking
the measurement to extend the limits of the chart into the future, record the date and the daily
measurement in the data table, and plot the point. The team should be alerted to investigate
immediately if a point exceeds the upper control limit or if runs of data (e.g., a large sequence of times
above the mean) are observed. (Please refer to the Run Chart section later in the chapter which defines
other rules for detecting patterns or “runs” in the data that may be signals to be investigated further.)
The chart was updated daily and continued to operate within limits until July 4, when
preparation time was observed to be 24 minutes, higher than the upper control limit (see TABLE 4.3B
and FIGURE 4.2B). The person taking the measurement immediately polled the team about what was
different that day. Obviously, it was a holiday, though that did not explain the special cause. Further
discussion with the team indicated that there had been a power outage during the night due to a
thunderstorm, and one of the computers used to check in patients failed to reboot automatically. A
manual restart was required, and this added to the clinic prep time. No action was taken on the

clinic preparation process, and indeed the preparation time the following day fell back within
the control limits and continued that way (see FIGURE 4.2C and the last three lines of Table 4.3B).
The predictability of this stable process allowed the staff to better plan the start of every day and
provided opportunities for the staff to establish process behavior charts on other key processes and
to systematically select ones to improve. Two important lessons are demonstrated in this case study
by the use of the XmR process behavior chart. First, as with any process behavior chart, analysis
prevented the team from taking unnecessary actions when a high value was first noted, since it was
within the upper control limits. Second, when a value was found that was above the upper control
limit a careful analysis was done to gain knowledge about the cause of this high value, and the
right questions were asked with input from team members, and in this case the cause was quickly
identified. These lessons demonstrate the value of using process behavior charts to monitor and
improve processes over time.
Methodological note: In reviewing Figures 4.2A, 4.2B, and 4.2C, it can be noted that Figures 4.2A
and 4.2B consist of one time series chart displaying individual preparation time (X) on the vertical
axis and date on the horizontal axis; this the traditional display associated with most process
behavior charts. The unique and quite important differentiation between these (XmR) charts and
other process behavior charts is the use of the average moving range and multiplication factors
(2.66) in determining the upper and lower control limits; the use of moving ranges to compute
control limits is the most important contribution of the use of XmR charts. In his foundational
work on this topic Wheeler (2000) describes the XmR chart as consisting of two charts by adding

a lower control chart display that presents the daily and average moving range and its upper limit.
Although useful in many cases as a valuable descriptive tool, it is our experience that this lower
(mR) chart is not always necessary to display, as long as the moving ranges have been computed
and used to compute control limits for detecting special cause variation. However, it should be
also noted that in this case analysis we did compute, but did not display, both charts. Wheeler, in
a more recent journal article, presents a good summary of reasons for including the moving range
chart when carrying out a process behavior analysis (Wheeler, 2010). Readers should consider
these arguments and based on the specific data being analyzed make a decision as to whether
both the X and mR charts are needed. For illustrative purposes both the upper chart of individual
values of preparation time (X) and lower chart presenting moving ranges (mR) are presented in
Figure 4.2C. The average and upper control limit presented in the lower chart are found using the
formulas presented above: the average of the mR values = 2.23 and the upper control limit of the
moving ranges is 7.3 (= 3.27 × 2.23). One other important computational note regarding the XmR
charts presented here is that the average of individual values (X) and moving ranges (mR) as well
as the upper and lower control limits for all three charts are based only on the first 14 days of data
collected. This was done for two reasons: (1) we considered the process to be stable based on the
process behavior chart computed for the first 14 days (i.e., it included enough cycles of the process
to reflect usual operating conditions); and (2) the first 14 days includes a sufficient amount of data
(at least 10 data points). These are two general guidelines that we recommend for computing the
initial averages and upper and lower control limits for generating process behavior charts, in general
(i.e., not specific to XmR charts). As we continue to monitor this process over a longer period of time
the centerline and limits should, of course, be recalculated once it is determined that an actual shift
has occurred, hopefully, due to a planned improvement. Further information on the choice of time
periods to compute average and control limits in XmR charts is found in Chapter 3 of Wheeler’s text,
Understanding Variation (2000), which has been cited several times in this case study and provides
examples that can serve as guidance on the development and interpretation of process behavior
charts, in general, and XmR charts specifically. Finally, it should be noted that the analyses and charts
presented in this case study were developed using Microsoft Excel™ although other options listed
below could also have been used.
Although in this case study, the source of the variation was quickly identified by the team, there
are often situations when more complex sources must be investigated. While guesses, “executive
decisions” and anecdotal information may seem like an easy way to decide on the action to be taken
(e.g., blame one of the new staff ), the proper way to proceed is to use input from knowledgeable
team members and when necessary use other CQI tools and techniques to gain knowledge about the
cause of this change in preparation time. With the knowledge that we have special cause variation,
tools and techniques such as those described later in this chapter (e.g., cause-and-effect diagram)
or methods that are described by other authors (e.g., root cause analysis; Ross, 2014) might be
appropriate. When a process is stable though not performing at the level needed by the customer,
strategies for improvement such as applying PDSA cycles to test whether changes that are made
lead to true improvement (Langley et al., 2009) and using a team approach (see Chapter 6 for more
details on the role of teams in CQI) should be applied. These step wise applications of improvement
tools and techniques are always recommended and are especially important to follow when we are
analyzing other health care processes that are more complex than the simple example presented
here. For instance, please see the patient safety examples in Chapters 9 and 10. The key conclusion of
this case study is that the process behavior chart is the most economic method, as originally proven
by Shewhart, for gaining knowledge about a process and, more importantly, distinguishing between
special and common cause variation. By understanding variation, we will know the appropriate action
to take for improvements.

Chapter 4 Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care

Other Forms of Control/Process
Behavior Charts
As noted above there are other forms of
control/process behavior charts that can also
be used to assess process behavior and may be
better known, such as the those that are not
based on moving ranges but on means of actual
values (X-bar charts) or percentages (P-charts)
and are applicable when we have more than
one data element per time point. For example,
Chapter 5 presents examples of X-bar charts
based on samples of patients to track “door to
doctor time” in an emergency department.
A good resource for further details and
formulae for how to compute control charts for
various types of data can be found at: https://
www.sqconline.com/about-control-charts.
Another source of software for computing
various types of controls charts is the R programming language (R Development Core
Team, 2014). However, as with all statistical
software, users are urged to study/question
findings carefully to understand and gain
knowledge from these user-friendly systems
before taking actions to change processes.

Quality Improvement
Tools

In Chapter 1, the Plan, Do, Study, Act cycle
was introduced, with an emphasis on its broad
applicability as a framework in which many
other CQI processes can be applied. Many
organizations, including health care organizations, have adopted the Plan, Do, Study,
Act (PDSA) cycle or a tailored version of it
as their overall framework for CQI (Langley
et al., 2009). Improvement begins with plotting a key quality characteristic of a process
over time on a run chart or control chart.
Then, depending upon the stability of the process, different tools, techniques, and methods
may be used to accomplish the purpose of
each phase of the PDSA cycle. (Once again,

as noted in Chapter 1, readers are reminded
that the PDSA cycle is sometimes described as
a PDCA cycle, where “C” stands for check, as
in checking your results of the Plan (“P”) and
Do (“D”) phases, which is equivalent to the “S”
study phase of a PDSA cycle; i.e., they are two
names for the same CQI process.)
There is no one specified point in the
CQI process where one needs to use a given
method of measurement and analysis. It
should be used on a continuous basis. In the
context of the PDSA cycle, data and analytical tools may be used throughout the entire
cycle. Different tools will be more helpful in
different stages of each improvement project,
from the initial analysis to monitoring changes
that have already been instituted. Reemphasizing the point made earlier in this chapter
about using data to learn about improvement,
Berwick (1996) notes that it is critical at the
studying (S) stage of a PDSA cycle to take the
time to reflect and learn about the impact of
improvements that have already been made.
This should include evaluating whether these
changes have actually been improvements and
then deciding on what further improvements
to make.
There are numerous tools and techniques
available to assist managers, clinicians, and
organizational teams in improving processes
to deliver desired results. These tools include
activity network diagrams; affinity diagrams;
box-plots, brainstorming; cause-and-effect
diagrams; check sheets; concentration diagrams; control charts; failure mode and effects
analysis (FMEA); flowcharts (process, deployment, top-down, opportunity); force field
analysis; frequency plots; histograms; interrelationship digraphs; matrix diagrams; Pareto
charts; prioritization matrices; process capability charts; radar charts; run charts; scatter
diagrams; Suppliers, Inputs, Process steps,
Outputs, Customers (SIPOC) diagrams; time
plots; tree diagrams; and workflow diagrams.
These tools are only useful if applied with an
understanding of variation described earlier or
results may be the opposite of improvement.

Quality Improvement Tools

While space does not permit detailed
description of this entire list of tools, six commonly used tools for CQI efforts in health care
are presented here; these are in addition to
control charts which were described above and
are included by many authors as an important
“CQI tool” for understanding variation and
knowing when process improvements are
needed e.g., The Improvement Guide; Langley
et al., 2009).
The tools to be described in this chapter
in addition to control charts are:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Run charts
Process flowcharts
Checklists
Cause-and-effect diagrams
Frequency charts
Pareto diagrams

This brief list of tools represents a range
of types that are useful for preventing errors,
describing process flow and for assessing ideas
for improvement, which are suitable depending upon the type of variation present in the
process. As noted above, one can visualize a
life cycle of the improvement team’s efforts
where these tools (and others not described
here) might be applied sequentially at various
project stages.

Run Charts
A control chart/process behavior chart has a
specific purpose for distinguishing between

common and special causes of variation and
thereby providing valuable information about
process predictability within limits. A run chart
is another useful tool with broad applications
in health care, to gain knowledge about process performance with minimal mathematical
complexity. “Because of its utility and simplicity, the run chart has wide potential application
in health care for practitioners and decisionmakers. Run charts also provide the foundation for more sophisticated methods of analysis
such as Shewhart (control) charts and planned
experiments” (Perla, Provost, & Murray, 2011,
p. 46). Run charts are graphical time series displays of process measurements along with the
median value of that measure; similar to control charts the vertical axis represents actual
values of some process measure of interest and
the horizontal axis presents a series of time
points at which process measures have been
collected; however, unlike control charts they
do not include upper and lower control limits.
FIGURE 4.3 presents an example of a simple but important run chart, illustrating how
(primary) data can be displayed to provide
knowledge and information about the effect
of making a change in procedures leading to
a desired result, consistently fewer medication
errors. This illustrates an important concept
about how data and tools can provide feedback
based on knowledge of systems and processes to
not only make improvements but to provide the
motivation for improvement (McLaughlin &
Kibbe, 2013).

Chapter 4 Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care

Once again, the most powerful tool for
distinguishing between common and special
causes of variation is the control chart/process
behavior chart; but some important uses of the
run chart (which it also shares with the control
chart) are:
■
■
■
■

Displaying data to make process performance visible
Determining if changes tested result in
improvement
Determining if we are holding the gains
made by our improvement
Allowing for a temporal (analytic) view
of data versus a static (enumerative) view
(Perla, Provost, & Murray, 2011, p. 47)

As its name implies, one very important
use of a run chart analysis is to detect trends
defined by runs in the data (i.e., “a consecutive sequence of data points all on the same
side of the median”; Balestracci, 2009, p. 147).
Balestracci (2009) provides guidance about
how many values in a row constitute a run,
and in particular, “the guideline” that a run
of 8 or more may indicate concern that there
are other than common causes of variation in
the data. In such cases, an investigation is warranted unless a process change was purposefully made. In the case of a planned change
that results in improvement, a shift in the process is expected and a new centerline (median)
should be computed starting from the time
that the process change was introduced; this is
illustrated in the example given in Figure 4.3.
Another useful characteristic of a run
chart, which is easily abused if care is not
taken, is the ability to identify an “astronomical data point…one that is obviously,
even blatantly different from the rest of the
points” (Perla, Provost, & Murray, 2011, p. 48).
Care should be taken when such points are
observed to not assume they are due to special
causes or represent signals, which can only be
identified using control charts. At most, such
points should be discussed by team members
to understand possible causes of these values
and attention should be paid to note whether

they are repeated over time. A definitive determination of special or common cause can only
be made by reanalyzing the process data using
a control chart, to determine if the astronomical data points fall outside of control limits.
Further details for how to compute and
interpret run charts and, in particular their
value in health care CQI, including their
strengths and weaknesses are presented by
Perla, Provost, & Murray (2011). Most texts
on CQI methods in health care/public health
describe the construction and interpretation of
run charts (Balestracci, 2009; Bialek, Duffy, &
Moran, 2009; Langley et al., 2009; Lloyd, 2019;
Spath & Kelly, 2017). For an example of how
to use run charts, together with control charts
and other tools, as part a LEAN management
system readers are referred to Chapter 5.

Process Flowcharts
As Langley et al. (2009) point out, CQI projects and teams requires some of the same
kinds of tools that are commonly used in project management for describing systems and
ensuring that all steps are carried out in the
proper sequence. Two tools that fall within
this definition are the project checklist and
process flowchart. One of the most powerful improvement tools for initiating inquiry
into a process improvement project is the
flowchart. Flowcharts (also called Flow Diagrams) are pictorial representations of how a
process works. Simply put, they trace the steps
that the input of a process goes through from
start to finish. The input may be a specimen
in laboratory tests, a piece of paper in medical records, or a patient in a specialty clinic.
Flowcharts are used to describe the sequence
of actions that must be carried out in order
to complete a particular task or set of tasks.
In systems thinking terminology the actions
performed on inputs are sometimes described
as throughput and the entire process that we
are studying/improving can be thought of as a
system that can be modeled using three major
components: input, throughput, and output

Quality Improvement Tools

(Grove, 1995). Donabedian (1980) first introduced similar systems thinking concepts that
were specific to health care when he defined
a model of quality of care based on the interrelationship of structure, process, and outcome. A flowchart is a first step in describing
the details (who, what, when) of each of the
components in these system models.
To develop a flowchart, one may proceed
as follows:
1.
2.

3.

4.

Define the basic stages of a process.
Further define the process, breaking
down each stage into specific steps
needed to complete the process.
Follow the input through the process a number of times to verify the
process by observation.
Discuss the process with the project team or other employees to
clarify the process and include any
steps that might be missing.

As the steps of a process are described,
they may be documented with simple rectangles or, in some cases greater complexity can
be described using traditional flowcharting
shapes to represent different steps or actions.
For example, an activity or action step is represented by a rectangle, a decision step by a
diamond, a wait or inventory by a triangle, a
document by a symbol that looks like a rectangle with a curve at the bottom, a file by a large
circle, and the continuation of the flowchart to
another sheet of paper by a small circle.
It is very important to note that flowcharts may be as simple or as complex as you
wish. It is important to agree on what level of
detail is suitable for the purpose. For example,
very detailed flowcharts may be used in standard operating procedures (SOPs) for highly
technical procedures. A high-level flowchart
may be used to describe a general overview
of how the process is carried out. FIGURE 4.4
shows a high-level (simple) flowchart of the
medication administration process for the
inpatient setting; note that this figure also
illustrates different shapes that can be used for

different activities. Once the general process is
described, more detail may be added, depending on the purpose of the analysis.
FIGURE 4.5 shows a more detailed flowchart
of a similar process. As more detail has been
added, the process has evolved from “medication
administration” to “medication management”
to include additional process stages involving
medication inventory management, pharmacy
management, and surveillance for adverse drug
events. Each step of this process may in turn be
mapped with a finer level of detail.
Members of a work team or improvement
project team are likely to find that there is no
common understanding of how the current
process or system works, especially if multiple providers or departments are responsible
for carrying out different steps of the process.
The development of flowcharts, with input
from all team members, allows the team to
achieve a common understanding of their
work processes and the important customer

and supplier relationships internal to the processes. These interdependencies are often the
key to sustainable process improvement. With
an accurate, shared representation of how the
process works, the team is then better able to
consider how to improve it.
Once agreement is reached on the representation of the current process, the team may
begin to ask questions about that process using
the flow chart and guided by a control chart of
measurements of process outputs, including:
1.
2.

3.

4.

5.
6.

How effective is the process in
meeting customer requirements?
Are there performance gaps
or perceived opportunities for
improvement?
Have the relevant stages of the process been represented? Are “owners” of each stage represented on the
team? If not, what needs to be done
to gather their feedback and ideas?
What are the inputs required for the
process, and where do they come
from? Are the inputs constraining
the process or not? Which ones?
Are there equipment or regulatory
constraints forcing this approach?
Is this the right problem process to
be working on? To continue working on?

The potential benefits of flowcharting are
considerable. Staff come to know the process
much better. A clear understanding of internal
customers and suppliers can be gleaned from
the overall process flow. The results can be
used as a training aid, especially as new staff
join the CQI team. People begin to take ownership of the process by participating in this
activity, and most importantly, the possibilities and points in the process for improvement
become clear almost immediately. And, in the
language of project management, the work
breakdown structure, timeline, and budget for
an improvement initiative can begin to take
shape through careful flow chart development
(Project Management Institute, 2017).

Other examples of flowcharts are found
throughout this text, including a description
of their valuable role in Lean Management
Systems, in Chapter 5, where flowcharts, also
denoted as process maps, are used to describe
emergency room patient flow and processes.

Checklists
Although it is neither a statistical tool nor a
completely new tool in quality improvement,
one that is very basic to both CQI and project management is the checklist. CQI in health
care includes as one of its primary goals the
prevention of errors (Crosby, 1979), which is
an important part of the overall goal of ensuring patient safety, defined as “freedom from
accidental or preventable injuries produced
by medical care” (AHRQ, 2016). This includes
prevention of medical errors, and adverse
events (outcomes of medical care); these issues
are described in Chapters 8, 9, and 10. (Please
note that a checklist is different from another
CQI tool with a similar name, the check sheet;
see Bialek, Duffy, & Moran, 2009.)
A checklist can take many forms, but in
its simplest form it is a list of process activities,
usually in a time ordered sequence, that must
be carried out by various members of a project or CQI team. As each task is completed,
a check mark is made next to the item that
was completed; in some cases, greater precision is obtained by indicating the date/time
that the task was completed or, if multiple
team members are involved in the process, the
initials of the team member who completed
the task may be entered as a way of ensuring
accountability. Checklists should be derived
from a process flowchart and apply to performing tasks in a stable process. Checklists
have been used for many years in other industries, such as the airline industry, and they
have long been an important component of
the project manager’s tool kit in many different industrial and health care settings. Their
role in improving airline safety is well documented and is an important reason that they

130

Chapter 4 Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care

have now seen an accelerated evolution into
medical care, which has had a greater focus
on safety issues in the early part of the 21st
century (Haynes et al., 2009; Gawande, 2009;
Pronovost et al., 2006; Pronovost et al., 2009).
Although not without controversy regarding
their effectiveness (Bosk et al., 2009), their
adoption as part of the medical safety process,
to be used in conjunction with other wellestablished evidence-based practices, continues as we have entered the second decade
of this century. Chapter 14 includes a critical review of some of the issues surrounding checklists and other commonly used
CQI tools and techniques with a warning
that before we assume that a “magic bullet”
exists which can be widely applied to guarantee quality we should take time to carefully
understand the context in which a CQI tool
or procedure has been developed and understand the limits of its generalizability to other
settings (Dixon-Woods & Martin, 2016). This
advice is particularly important for checklists, whose broad applicability may have been
overstated by some, but does not negate their
value as a CQI tool if used properly; the same
can be said of most tools presented in this and
other CQI texts.
In addition to the references cited in the
preceding paragraph, Chapters 1, 2, and 8
of this text provide further discussion of the
use of checklists in health care. A discussion
of how to understand the specific issues surrounding practitioner adoption of checklists
through the use of a social marketing approach
is presented by Breland (2012) in the form of
a case study.

Cause-and-Effect Diagram
Cause-and-effect diagrams, also called Ishikawa or fishbone diagrams, are one of the
most widely used tools of CQI. This tool was
developed by Kaoru Ishikawa (University
of Tokyo) for use at Kawasaki Steel Works
in 1943 to sort and interrelate the common
causes of process variation (Ishikawa, 1987).

Cause-and-effect diagrams are most useful
to begin to identify common causes of variation once the process has been determined
to be stable and documented using a process
flowchart. However, they are also very useful when special causes have been identified,
perhaps via a process behavior chart analysis
and the next step is decide what actions need
to be taken to prevent the special cause from
recurring. Cause-and-effect diagrams are a
schematic means of relating causes of variation to the process output and predictability.
It is important to note that not all errors are
special causes. Errors can be produced by a
process with only common causes of variation
present. Therefore, it is critical to determine
the type of variation that is present before constructing the cause-and-effect diagram, since
the strategy for improvement is different. In
either case, the first pass at a cause-and-effect
diagram may not be enough to understand the
cause-and-effect relationships. Therefore, it
may be necessary to stratify cause-and-effect
diagrams further to achieve finer gradations
of error causes. Increasing the level of detail
about causes can help with identifying specific
action for improvement.
This tool is especially suited for team
situations and is quite useful for focusing a
discussion and organizing large amounts of
information resulting from a brainstorming
session. It can be taught easily and quickly,
allowing the group to sort ideas into useful
categories for further investigation. The diagram is also referred to as a “fishbone” diagram because the shape resembles the skeleton
of a fish.
FIGURE 4.6 shows the multilayered process
of making a fishbone diagram. Step 1 of the
diagram shows the identified performance gap
or problem at the right and a big arrow leading
to it that represents the overall causation. Step 2
involves drawing spines from that big arrow to
represent main classifications or categories of
causes, such as labor, materials, and equipment.
Step 3 adds the specific causes along each major
spine, which also may occur at multiple levels.

Sometimes it is useful to draw the diagram in
two stages—one showing the main causes and

FIGURE 4.7 illustrates a cause-and-effect
diagram that may be used to describe common

In some cases, after a cause-and-effect diagram
is generated, data are collected to quantify how
often the different causes occur. These data
must then be presented to the study team and
later to others. When measures are based on
discrete/attribute data, the simplest display is
a frequency chart, a vertical bar chart representing the frequency distribution of a set of
data. It is most useful when the measures we
are studying are discrete/attribute data but may
also be used by collapsing continuous measures in “class-intervals.” The bars are arrayed
on the horizontal (x) axis representing equal or
adjacent data intervals or discrete events. The
length (height) of the bar against the vertical
(y) axis shows the number of observations
falling on that interval or event classification.
The frequency chart displays the nature of the
underlying statistical distribution; however, it
does not provide any information about process stability and should only be used with a
control chart indicating that the process is only
producing statistically controlled variation.
FIGURE 4.8 shows a frequency chart of the frequency and causes for the discarding of hospital linens.
A Pareto diagram is a frequency chart
with the bars arranged from the longest (most
frequent) first on the left and moving successively toward the shortest. The arrangement of
the vertical bars gives a visual indication of the
relative frequency of the contributing causes
of the problem, with each bar representing
one cause.
The diagram is named after the 17thcentury Italian economist, Vilfredo Pareto.

When he studied the distribution of wealth, he
observed that the majority of the wealth had
been distributed among a small proportion
of the population (Pareto’s law). Juran (1988)
applied this concept to quality causes, observing that the “vital few” causes account for most
of the defects, while others, the “useful many,”
account for a much smaller proportion of the

defects. He noted that these vital few causes
are likely to constitute the areas of highest
payback to management. Concentrating on
the high-volume causes may have the largest
potential for reducing process variation once
special causes have been eliminated.
On the same Pareto diagram, one also
develops a cumulative probability distribution

Quality Improvement Tools

incorporating all the proportions of the observations to the left of and including the bar. It
is common to display the frequency scale on
the left-hand side of the vertical (y) axis and
the cumulative percentage scale on the righthand edge. Segregating the causes that have
large frequencies can help identify potential
improvements. However, just because a cause
is identified as having the greatest frequency
does not necessarily mean it should be worked
on first. It must also be tractable and not cost
more to change than it is worth. It is likely,
however, that the first cause to be studied in
detail will be among the left-most group. It is
important to remember that even though a
cause may not be among the most frequent,
if it has a devastating result, such as causing
a patient death, it must be addressed in the
course of the improvement effort.
Once the cause-and-effect diagram, such
as the one in Figure 4.7 which identifies possible causes of adverse drug events, has been
described data would be collected on the frequency of the specific causes. FIGURE 4.9 illustrates how a Pareto chart can be developed to
analyze the frequency of causes identified in
the cause-and-effect diagram. For example,
Figure 4.9 displays how often the “Five Rights
of Medication Administration” contributed to

an adverse drug event (ADE). Of 100 ADEs
investigated, the Pareto chart shows that
“wrong time” occurred most frequently, with
“wrong patient” next, and so on.
Through these examples, one can begin
to see how the tools fit together to support
CQI and patient safety. Since the Institute
of Medicine report To Err Is Human (IOM,
2000) was published, the topic of medical
errors and adverse events has become a priority area for customers and stakeholders of
health care organizations. TJC’s review process now includes accreditation standards
addressing patient safety, medical errors, and
adverse events (also see Chapter 12). As illustrated by the preceding examples, various CQI
tools, alone and in combination, can be used to
address this critical area of concern.
Combinations of tools, such as flowcharts,
Pareto charts, run charts, and control charts,
may be used together in a lean management
process analysis/improvement initiative in an
emergency room setting as described in Chapter 5. A good description of the many tools that
can be applied in health is found in The Public
Health Quality Improvement Handbook (Bialek,
Duffy, & Moran, 2009). Other examples of
applications via case studies illustrating these
concepts and tools are found in Implementing

Chapter 4 Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care

Continuous Quality Improvement in Health
Care—A Global Casebook (McLaughlin,
Johnson, & Sollecito, 2012).
When faced with the task of developing specific tools there are various types of
software, such as those described earlier for
developing process behavior charts (e.g., “R”;
R Development Core Team, 2014) or Microsoft’s ExcelTM tool that can be used; there
are also websites that provide tutorials and
templates to facilitate the understanding,
development, and use of the tools discussed
in this chapter, and other useful tools and
methodologies (e.g., http://asq.org/learn
-about-quality/seven- basic-quality-tools
/overview/overview.html; also https://www
.sqconline.com). As noted earlier, users are
urged to study and question findings carefully
to understand and gain knowledge from these
user-friendly systems before taking actions to
change processes.

▸

Sources of Data for CQI

Decisions about process performance and
improvements and the application of CQI
tools often start by accessing quality data in
a step wise “data-to-decision cycle.” This cycle
begins with data that are transformed into
information, which facilitates identification
of opportunities for improvement and then
leads to the transformation of information
into knowledge, about how to redesign processes (e.g., based on best practices). Ultimately these steps result in decisions and
actions to make changes and provide feedback on the need for further improvements
(e.g., in a classic PDSA cycle; McLaughlin &
Kibbe, 2013). Of course, all decisions should
be informed by an understanding of variation
as previously defined.
In defining sources of data for CQI initiatives, it is important to consider timeliness of
the data being collected as well as accessibility.
Most critical to this process is the quality of the

data that are the input to this decision-making
cycle. As with any good statistical analysis,
data collected for CQI must be of the highest quality and every effort must be taken to
ensure this. No matter which tool or procedure
is used to perform CQI, its findings will only
be as good as the data that they are based on.
The age-old acronym GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out) must always be kept in mind when
deciding on data sources for CQI.
Ensuring the highest data quality requires
the application of data standards, data management and quality assurance procedures
(Loshin, 2011) to ensure that the information used to make CQI decisions is correct.
Also important in ensuring data quality is
proper training of team members involved
in CQI initiatives (McLaughlin & Kibbe,
2013, p. 343):
Quality improvement teams are temporary systems whose members may
or may not be skilled observers and
data recorders. Teams may also have
to depend on observers who are not
team members. Management must
make sure that the appropriate team
members are trained to observe
and record the relevant events and
variables. They also should make
sure that all those likely to become
involved understand the CQI process
and the importance of reliable data.
This may also be backed up with validation of those data that are most
critical in determining which alternative procedure to adopt.
Two major classifications can be used to
describe data that are applicable to most CQI
initiatives: primary data and secondary data.

Primary Data
For CQI applications primary data can be
defined as data that are collected specifically for

Sources of Data for CQI

the purposes of measuring process performance
and improvement (i.e., providing information and knowledge about the specific practice
setting or other health care environment that
allows for improvement decisions to be made).
The data presented in the Case Study earlier in this chapter, which were used to develop
an XmR process behavior chart, are a good
example of how primary data can be collected
to provide knowledge and understanding about
the need for process improvements. Another
example might be the use of primary data that
were specifically collected to provide knowledge about medication errors in a medical
practice (e.g., using data collected over a fixed
time period and displayed using one of the CQI
tools discussed earlier in this chapter—such as
the run chart example presented in Figure 4.3).

Sampling Considerations
Primary data analyses can involve collection of
all available data for a fixed amount of time, as
was done in the case study presented earlier, but
quite often, the use of primary data is based on
scientific sampling methods. In either case, a
clearly defined sampling strategy is a first step.
Any sampling strategy that is used should
start with a clear definition of the measures to
be selected and the specific sampling methodology that is to be used to select patients
or subjects. Two common methodologies in
health care are probability (random) sampling and judgement sampling. Also important, especially when process behavior charts
involving time-series displays of data are
required, is defining how often sample elements will be collected.
Perla, Provost, and Murray present two
important concepts, based on the previous
work of CQI pioneers, Deming and Shewhart,
which provide guidance for sampling in
improvement projects:
1.

Obtaining just enough data based
on past experience to guide our
learning in the future.

2.

135

Making full use of subject matter expertise in selecting the most
appropriate samples. (2013, p. 37)

Following these guidelines, CQI data are
often drawn from judgement or purposive
samples. This differs from the types of sampling methods that are used when the goal is
to make predictions or derive estimates about
large populations, as is the case with probability sampling. Judgement sampling is used in
CQI and in health care applications beyond
CQI, such as the selection of patients who meet
specific entry criteria in clinical trials, by experienced clinical investigators. Judgement sampling is applicable to CQI when collecting data
to measure improvement because such data
often come from ongoing processes where we
rarely have a fixed population of interest, but
instead have a population that is changing over
time. In process improvement studies, subject
matter experts can be relied upon to choose
areas, times of the day, or segments of the
population to best represent the process being
studied for CQI purposes. (Perla, Provost, &
Murray, 2013) When random sampling is being
used, for example to measure patient satisfaction, the first step is to carefully identify the
sampling frame, defined as the source of data
for the key elements that are to be analyzed and
from which a sample is to be taken in order to
make inferences about the larger population of
interest, such as the medical care database from
the institution whose quality we are assessing.
Also critical to successful sampling strategies is
careful determination of sample size. Sample
size is always important because it plays a role
in determining precision of estimates of quality
metrics and also directly affects study cost estimates (Levy & Lemeshow, 2008).
Also important in probability sampling
is estimating the prevalence of the measures
being studied:
Our experience is that the first
thing that often happens is that the

136

Chapter 4 Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care

designers overestimate the prevalence of the phenomenon being studied and hence underestimate the cost
of finding enough affected individuals. When the recruitment of participants lags, the perception that the
budget is fixed leads to a reduction
in those cases surveyed, often jeopardizing what conclusions might be
reached. The team must test those
prevalence assumptions early on and
plan realistically; one of the ways this
can be accomplished is through the
use of smaller “pilot” studies prior to
carrying out the final survey. Interorganizational access to data could
make the task of assessing prevalence
much easier as well. (McLaughlin &
Kibbe, 2013, p. 346)
Whether probability or judgement sampling is used to select primary data an important data quality concern is consideration of
“non-sampling” errors (those that cannot be
controlled by traditional sample design and
statistical analysis adjustments). One very
important example of this type of error that
is quite prevalent in health care surveys, such
as those used to measure patient satisfaction, is non-response (i.e., when the number
who respond to a survey is smaller than the
number selected to be studies). High levels of
non-response can lead to selection bias and
under-representation of the patients intended
to be surveyed, sometimes also compromising
the power of any statistical or process behavior
analysis to be carried out based on these data.
Quite simply, if a sample of patients is selected,
and patients are contacted to provide feedback
on patient care they have received, the data
derived from such a survey will only be useful
if a high response rate is obtained. This fact is
true for all types of scientific surveys, but especially health surveys, including those that used
to assess and improve quality of care.
An example of this phenomenon in large
health care institutions is the use of patient

satisfaction surveys, such as those conducted
by the Press Ganey organization, which partners with more than 50% of U.S. hospitals to
improve health and business outcomes (Press
Ganey Associates, Inc., 2017; Wake Forest–
Baptist Health, 2016). Measuring patient
satisfaction is an important way to ensure a
customer focus, a basic tenet of CQI in health
care, and such efforts are to be applauded. But
two key factors to pay close attention to in
these efforts to measure patient satisfaction
are adequacy of sample size and consideration/
control of non-response. For example, Wake
Forest Baptist Hospital in North Carolina,
which has earned a “Press Ganey Seal of Integrity” reports that the patient survey results in
their organization are based on a random selection of outpatients who receive questionnaires
via regular mail or email within a few weeks
of their appointments. They also report that
the target sample size for computing individual provider ratings is 30, and that the average
response rate is 18%, which varies by specialty.
Results are posted on-line as part of provider
profiles, unless fewer than 30 responses are
received, in which case it is the provider’s
choice as to whether results will be posted.
One reason given for this procedure is that it is
recognized that smaller sample sizes will lead
to high variability in ratings due to extreme
values (Wake Forest–Baptist Health, 2016). It
may be assumed that this survey process and
these numbers are similar for other large hospital systems. A first step to consider when
evaluating the knowledge gained from such a
survey process, especially for CQI, is to determine whether the response rate is sufficient to
make quality of care decisions. While a target
of 100% response is a goal, it is not achievable
in most cases, so the question remains: What is
an acceptable response rate? The answer to this
question will vary depending on the decision
to be made and should include relevant team
members and the use of tools such as those
described earlier in this chapter. For example, if
survey response rates are considered to be inadequate, then a cause-and-effect analysis may be

Sources of Data for CQI

considered as a way to understand and increase
response rates. Also important to consider are
other forms of non-response, such as selective
responses, which may not be representative of
true patient satisfaction—for example, if those
who do respond had an extreme experience,
whether superb or terrible.
In addition to response rate issues sample
size must also be considered before making
decisions related to quality of care. For example, when target sample sizes are not achieved,
unacceptably high margins of error may invalidate conclusions based on survey data and
especially comparisons over time or between
departments or providers (Zusman, 2012).
Decisions based on patient survey results also
require careful consideration of the limits of
the data and possible confounding factors that
may influence findings; for example, there
have been reports of physicians’ employment
and income being threatened based on poor
satisfaction scores and some assertions that
patient satisfaction scoring actually leads to
poorer quality of care due to some providers altering medical treatment to influence
patient satisfaction scores (Zusman, 2012).
These examples underline how important it
is important to consider both the source of
the data being collected in measuring quality
and also how the results are used; attention to
detail on both extremes—data collection and
decision making—is critical.
Despite some criticism of patient satisfaction surveys, their use is increasing, which
creates opportunities for continuous improvement. There is a current trend to increase
the use of patient satisfaction and spurred by
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act (ACA) and other legislation attempts to
improve and expand such processes are underway. For example, an improved patient satisfaction survey that is being used and is tied to
hospital reimbursement is the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Health Care Providers
and Systems (HCAHPS; Zusman, 2012).
In summary, the widespread use of patient
satisfaction surveys and associated criticisms

137

lead to an important conclusion relative to
this chapter and the use of primary survey
data in CQI. The key point to be taken from
this discussion is not to demean the efforts of
measuring patient satisfaction; but in the same
way that process improvement actions should
only be taken when there is evidence of special
cause variation, the same advice applies to only
taking action based on surveys of (patients or
providers) when data sources are proven to be
reliable and high quality and are sufficient to
support the level of decisions to which they
are being applied. It is important for those
who make use of survey data to carefully consider the basic principles of measurement and
understanding variation before taking actions
and whenever possible use knowledge gained
to improve processes, including survey methodology processes.

Secondary Data
Secondary data are data that are collected for
purposes other than the specific process performance or improvement initiative that is of
interest. Especially with the broad availability of data that can be accessed via the internet and with a proper investment in Health
Information Technology (HIT) secondary
data have become and will continue to be
very useful for carrying out CQI initiatives.
Secondary data sources that can support CQI
include data registries and claims data. One
rich source of claims data represents information available as part of the Medicare program,
administered by the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (CMS; McLaughlin &
Kibbe, 2013). Although claims data have been
frequently criticized for poor quality in the
past, more recently, CMS has implemented
a number of innovative approaches to drive
quality improvement at the national level.
These include adopting the use and promoting the development of standard quality measures, public reporting of quality
measures, and pay-for-performance efforts
to reward physicians for providing better

138

Chapter 4 Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care

QIO EXAMPLE: CLEMSON NURSING HOME
An example of how QIOs utilize CMS data to carry out CQI can be seen in the case of Clemson’s
nursing home. This 95-bed, family-owned nursing home, located in the foothills of North Carolina, was
attempting to reduce restraint use in its facility. Clemson received an invitation from the state QIO to
participate in a restraint-reduction quality improvement initiative. Using data from all nursing homes
in the state (available through the CMS “Minimum Data Set (MDS)” reporting system), the QIO provided
Clemson with graphs illustrating that its restraint use was higher than the state and national averages,
ranking them as having the fourth highest restraint use rate among nursing homes in the initiative.
Working with the QIO, Clemson conducted a root-cause analysis (Ross, 2014) and identified several
opportunities for reducing restraints. Testing new processes using PDSA cycles over a period of several
weeks, Clemson was able to reduce restraint use from 10% to 6% and ultimately achieved its goal of 3%
by the end of the initiative (Schenck, McArdle, & Weiser, 2013, p. 435).
Further details on this example can also be found in a case study (Rokoske, McArdle, & Schenck,
2012) included in our previously published casebook (McLaughlin, Johnson, & Sollecito, 2012).

quality care (McLaughlin & Kibbe, 2013),
Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs),
are Medicare’s primary agents for carrying
out quality improvement initiatives using
CMS (secondary) data sources (Schenck,
McArdle, & Weiser, 2013). With a presence
in every state and most federal territories,
QIOs have been called “the nation’s main
infrastructure for quality improvement”
(Hsia, 2003).

Electronic Health Records
An important source of secondary data that is
being used more frequently to carry out CQI
studies is electronic health records (EHR).
Over 90% of hospitals and physician practices
now have some form of EHR systems in place.
The ubiquity of EHRs is primarily due to the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009 (ARRA). ARRA established incentive
payments to promote the adoption and meaningful use of interoperable HIT and EHRs.
Beginning in 2011, the Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Record Incentive Programs were established to encourage eligible
professionals and eligible hospitals to adopt,
implement, upgrade (AIU), and demonstrate
meaningful use of certified EHR technology.

Meaningful use is using certified EHR
technology to:
■
■
■
■

Improve quality, safety, efficiency, and
reduce health disparities
Engage patients and family
Improve care coordination, and population and public health
Maintain privacy and security of patient
health information

Meaningful Use was implemented in
3 stages.
■

■

■

Stage 1 (2011–2012) set the foundation
for the EHR Incentive Programs by establishing requirements for the electronic
capture of clinical data, including providing patients with electronic copies of
health information.
Stage 2 (2014) expanded upon the Stage 1
criteria with a focus on ensuring that the
meaningful use of EHRs supported the
aims and priorities of the National Quality Strategy. Stage 2 criteria encouraged
the use of HIT for CQI at the point of care
and the exchange of information in the
most structured format possible.
In October 2015, CMS released a final
rule that specifies criteria that eligible

Conclusions

professionals, eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) must meet
in order to participate in the EHR Incentive Programs in 2015 through 2017
(Modified Stage 2) and in Stage 3 in 2017
and beyond (CDC, 2017; CMS, 2017a;
CMS, 2015a).
CMS has also provided guidance on the
choice and use of clinical measures in EHRs
through the definition of clinical quality measures (CQMs) that can be used to carry out
CQI.
CQMs are tools that help measure
and track the quality of health care
services provided by eligible professionals, eligible hospitals and critical
access hospitals (CAHs) within our
health care system. These measures
use data associated with providers’
ability to deliver high-quality care or
relate to long term goals for quality
health care. CQMs measure many
aspects of patient care including:
■
■
■
■
■
■
■
■

health outcomes
clinical processes
patient safety
efficient use of health care
resources
care coordination
patient engagements
population and public health
adherence to clinical guidelines

(CMS, 2015b; 2017b).

Ultimately, it is hoped that the meaningful
use compliance and the use of CQMs will result
in better clinical outcomes, improved population health outcomes, increased transparency
and efficiency, empowered individuals and
more robust research data on health systems.
Most recently, the widespread use of
EHRs provides a new source of secondary
data that has many useful characteristics for
CQI applications, especially in large health
systems where direct access to patient data via

139

primary data collection methods may be costly
or infeasible for other reasons.
EHR systems can be very useful especially
in large health care systems, because of features
such as interoperability, linking patient care
across multiple institutions, and the ability to
capture details of interactions between providers and patients with linkages to various forms
of health indicators (e.g., laboratory results).
However, it is most important to recognize
that most EHR systems were not designed for
the purpose of carrying out detailed analyses
required for CQI tools and techniques and
although they may include predefined metrics
and summaries via “dashboards” these data
may not provide the level of specificity needed
to meet specific process measurement and
improvement requirements. Once again, we
advise that wherever CQI studies are not based
on primary data collected for the specific purposes of the process evaluation/improvement
study of interest, caution must be applied to
understand knowledge gained and specifically
sources of variation before taking actions.

Conclusions

This chapter described the importance of measurement concepts in CQI. Most important is
understanding variation and, in particular,
understanding the distinction between special
and common causes of variation and how this
understanding determines the most appropriate action for improvement. It has been illustrated that the most effective way to understand
process variation is to plot data over time,
preferably, on a control chart/process behavior chart. Once the appropriate improvement
strategy is determined, then the use of CQI
tools described here together with other methodologies described in this text (e.g., PDSA,
is recommended). A case study designed to
facilitate classroom discussion and published
data examples have been presented to illustrate the application of these methodologies.
This chapter also provided a brief overview of

primary and secondary data sources that are
a critical input to the “data-to-decision” cycle
that is applicable to assessing and improving
process performance, with a brief review of
the strengths and weaknesses of various data
sources, relative to CQI applications.
This chapter has not attempted to
exhaustively cover the broad range of topics

associated with CQI tools and techniques.

igh-performing health care organizations differentiate themselves by
focusing relentlessly on improving
their service and performance and are guided
by process-improvement initiatives to advance
patient care. Continuous quality improvement
offers a powerful way of thinking about how
to transform clinical operations and health
care teams. Continuous Quality Improvement
(CQI), Lean Management Systems (LMS),

and Lean Six Sigma (LSS) are philosophies
and methods for leadership, management,
improvement, and innovation. They offer an
approach, a set of tools, and a way of thinking
about how to more effectively study, assess,
and improve clinical flow, including addressing and reducing variations in processes and
operations. LMS and LSS are also broadly
generalizable to other health applications
such as public health (see Chapter 11) and
a broad array of settings, including applying CQI in resource poor countries (see
Chapter 13). For illustrative purposes, the
primary focus of this chapter will be on traditional health care delivery systems in
developed countries.

Chapter 5 Lean and Six Sigma Management

Lean and Six Sigma
Management Defined

Six Sigma, as its name implies (sigma being
the Greek symbol used in statistics to measure
variation), utilizes statistical methods to identify and reduce variation in processes (Duffy,
Farmer, & Moran, 2009). (See Chapter 4 for
a detailed description of types and causes of
variability.)
In 1986, when Motorola originated and
launched the continuous improvement and
innovation effort they called Six Sigma, it was
an evolution of quality methods that originated in in the United States and Japan that
then further developed at Motorola. The U.S.
and Japanese quality leaders, followed by other
companies, learned from each other as they
further evolved systems of quality management. Ford Motor Company developed mass
production systems that Toyota developed
further into the Toyota Production System
(TPS) through their emphasis on elimination
of waste, which they termed muda, muri, and
mura (Muda, muri, mura—Toyota production
system guide, 2013).

Muda: Wasting Resources
Muda is the waste due to nonvalue-added
activities, which was translated back by companies in the United States as elimination of
waste in the use of seven resources: transportation, inventory, motion during production, waiting time spent during production,
over-processing (by doing more than necessary), over-production (by producing more
products or items than needed), and defects,
such as producing faulty parts or making mistakes in the process. Often, the focus of the
Lean Management System (LMS) in health
care is reducing muda, especially with respect
to waiting time experienced by patients, mistakes or “near misses” in patient care, transitions in patient care due to transportation

and/or motion in moving patients between
care providers or services, and managing
inventory of equipment and supplies. Thus,
examples of waste in health care include
wasted inventory, rework, excess waiting
time—whether by patients or staff members who need results of another provider’s
inputs to make decisions—lost time, errors,
or extra work associated with poor processing
of information or outdated procedures, and
waste from transporting patients unnecessarily (Spath & Kelly, 2017).

Muri: Overburdening Staff and
Equipment
Muri is the waste due to over-burdening
the people or equipment in the process, as
processes that are balanced are desirable.
Less-than-optimal attention paid to muri in
health care often is evident when physicians
and staff feel overwhelmed with the level of
effort required for them to provide patient
care, document the care provided, address
regulatory reporting requirements, attend
required meetings, and provide all the support
beyond the effort required for patient care.
Burnout is experienced by many physicians
and health care providers. Improving the balance of processes is an imperative in patient
care delivery.

Mura: Uneven Process Workflow
Mura is the waste due to unevenness in the
process workflow. Mura is the reason for the
development of “just-in-time” production
systems so that the process flow is more predictable and consistent. In health care, the
desire to “get things off your plate” and send
it to the next function in the process is common. In other words, rather than providing
each person what is needed at the time it is
needed, there is a tendency to batch up work
and then send it in “one pile” to the next
step in the process. Examples include batch

Lean and Six Sigma Management Defined

reading of radiology exams rather than reading the exam at the time the patient is present
and providing the results for each individual
patient as they progress their patient care process. Morning blood draws in an acute care
setting are another example, as the blood is
drawn and sent to pathology in batches to do
the analyses.

To achieve these goals, Motorola recognized that:
■

■

How Six Sigma Originated
Motorola was very much aware of the quality methodology practiced in Japan, including just-in-time processing, POKA-YOKE
(“fool-proofing processes”), process simplification, and continuous improvement by all
staff (Harry, 1998). They observed that efficient and effective process flow through the
elimination or reduction of nonvalued-added
processing could not only reduce the number of errors or defects in production, but it
also could increase the consistency of performance of the process. Motorola decided to
select skilled staff with technical backgrounds
and train them in advanced quality, engineering, manufacturing, and statistical methodology, which in turn facilitated their ability
to improve or innovate the design of both
their products and work processes. Motorola
established two improvement goals as part
of what they defined as their Total Customer
Satisfaction (TCS) strategy:
1.

2.

All defects were to be reduced
10-fold every 2 years, which implies
a 68% improvement per year. For
example, a process yielding a success rate of 90% is expected to perform at 96.8% success rate at the
end of Year 1, and 99% at the end
of Year 2. Note that in the 2 years,
the failure rate would be expected
to drop from 10% to 1%, which is a
10-fold improvement.
All core processes must reduce
their cycle time (lead time) by 50%
within 2 years.

145

Variation in process performance can
lead to greater defect/error rates. Therefore, a reduction in process variation can
induce a lower rate of defects, where a
defect was defined as the failure of a process to achieve its goals.
Speeding up processes requires the elimination of unnecessary (e.g., nonvalueadded) tasks or steps since simply doing
the same steps faster in order to achieve a
50% reduction in cycle time often will drive
more defects while overwhelming workers
and which violates the simultaneous goal of
a reduction in defect rates.

In 1990, the term “Lean Production”
received attention due to the book The
Machine That Changed the World by James
Womack, Daniel Jones, and Daniel Roos. The
authors explained that mass production systems emanating from Toyota via Ford and
other companies were evolving into a coherent
narrative that enabled systems requiring less
time for production, less effort from people,
lower inventories of supplies, and less capital
investment. Remarkably, this new system of
work could yield fewer defects, yet it was able
to better mass customize by serving smaller
and smaller market sizes at lower costs.
In 1996, Womack & Jones published Lean
Thinking, which distilled the LMS theory into
five principles:
1.
2.

3.

4.

The customer defines value.
Organizations should identify the
value stream in every process and
seek to eliminate all wasted steps
that do not add value.
Organizations should make the
product (or, in health care, management of the patient’s care) flow
through the steps of the valueadded process continuously.
Organizations need subsequent
steps in the process that “pull”

146

Chapter 5 Lean and Six Sigma Management

5.

products (or patients) from the
previous steps rather than push
them forward, causing them to
batch up waiting for the next step.
Organizations should work to
continuously improve in order to
reduce steps, time, costs, and the
information (data) needed to serve
the customer (again, the patient in
our case; Anthony, Palsuk, Gupta,
Mishra, & Barach, 2018).

It was not until the later 1990s that consultants decided to call the time-based techniques “Lean,” although these methods had
already been incorporated into Motorola’s
two simultaneous goals of the Six Sigma
program. The more technical analyses that
incorporated variation and defect reduction
were called Six Sigma by many, rather than
the more encompassing meaning behind Six
Sigma as envisioned by Motorola. Motorola
viewed what later became called LMS and
Six Sigma as separate management activities
that were “two sides of the same coin,” which
they simply called Six Sigma. For example,
having fewer steps to accomplish the same
process leads to fewer steps in which to
make errors, less variation across the process, and ultimately to better, cheaper, and
faster processes.
Michael George is one of the people credited with popularizing the term “Lean Six
Sigma.” Acknowledging this “two sides of the
same coin,” he wrote (George, 2002, p. 7):
Lean Six Sigma is a methodology
that maximizes shareholder value
by achieving the fastest rate of
customer satisfaction, cost, quality,
process speed, and invested capital.
The fusion of LMS and Six Sigma is
required because:
■
LMS cannot bring a process
under statistical control.
■
Six Sigma alone cannot dramatically improve process speed or
reduce invested capital.

Thomas L. Jackson and Karen R. Jones
note that organizations cannot incorporate a
LMS overnight. More specifically (Jackson &
Jones, 1996, pp. 7–8),
To support lean production, management must build, nurture, and
support the logic and machinery
that drives lean production. Lean
Management is actually a sophisticated practice built around several
key conceptual and physical tools. It
is about looking at your company in
an entirely different way, describing
its processes with a new vocabulary.
The process that delivers lean management has been designed, tested,
and refined into what we call the lean
management system. This system
reflects the principles and methodologies of leading international managers and consultants.
“Lean Six Sigma” (LSS) adoption in
health care and public health represents an
evolution resulting in part from alliances and
interchanges with corporate and government
partners, and it promoted the evolution of CQI
across several industries (Duffy, Farmer, &
Moran, 2009). The combination of LMS and
Six Sigma is now being used in a wide range
of health care applications, and provides a
synergistic methodology for analyzing, and
reducing or eliminating waste in health care
processes.
The following sections of this chapter will
define these methodologies in greater detail by
describing their use in health care settings and,
in particular, by illustrating patient flow LMS
applications.

Patient Flow as an
Application of LSS
Organizations that focus on improving
value-added activities can develop a strategic
and competitive advantage (Byrne, 2013, p. xi).

Lean and Six Sigma Management Defined

Improving process “flow” is one of the primary
goals of LSS and CQI. A value stream or process with optimum flow would be analogous
to a river that cascades over a cliff and rages
through a narrow gorge, flowing downhill with
no bends, rocks, or other impediments. This
is akin to a clinic with high patient flow and
demand that has the right number of highly
skilled staff working with patients to meet their
care needs using well-designed processes that
have minimal waste (Sanchez & Barach, 2012).
Staff are patient-focused leaders who manage
with the “right” data, and they empower staff
to continuously improve the workplace as they
deliver exceptional care.
With the advent of the 21st century, there
have been discernable improvements in the
efficiency and effectiveness of care in some
settings, including broader applications of
what has been called the Triple Aim of Health
Care: improving (1) the experience of care and
(2) population health while (3) reducing costs
(Berwick, Nolan, & Whittington, 2008). However, despite this progress, patients still experience unacceptable harm; processes are not as
efficient as they could be; and costs continue
to rise at alarming rates, while quality issues
remain. The key to ensuring CQI in health care
organizations is changing organizational culture, as discussed in Chapter 2. Organizations
seeking to be efficient and effective in care
delivery need to embed a culture that identifies wasteful effort, seek ways to continually
improve existing processes, and design processes for those that do not currently exist in
order to increase efficiency and effectiveness in
meeting their outcomes with no wasted effort.
Womack and Jones correctly observed that “…
patients often discover that the time spent on
treatment was a tiny fraction of the time you
spent going through the “process.” Mostly you
were sitting and waiting (“patient” is clearly the
right word), or moving about to the next step
in the diagnosis and treatment…” (2003, p. 50).
If waiting is a nonvalue-adding activity,
why do most health care facilities incorporate a formal “waiting” room into their care

147

delivery processes? When flow is attained and
information, materials, and activity proceed
seamlessly through processes without interruption, then optimal experiences can occur.
This is more likely to happen if leaders ensure
“rules that require the learning of skills, they
set up goals, they provide feedback, and they
make control possible. They facilitate concentration and involvement by making the activity as distinct as possible from the so-called
paramount reality of everyday existence”
(Csikszentmihalyi, 1990, p. 72).
This “ideal state” can be approached and
accomplished in real terms by integrating the
principals that govern patient flow and variation management—we call it patient flow
physics, a nod to the universality of the physical
rules that govern the universe and LMS. As presented in this chapter, this powerful gestalt can
greatly increase the achievement of key process
core measures in health care. (Readers are also
referred to similar concepts related to time
management that are illustrated by control chart
analyses of a clinic start up time in Chapter 4.)
We begin the discussion with two real-world
examples, the first from an emergency department (ED), and the second from an ambulatory
screening mammography clinic.

Applying LSS to Patient Flow in
Community Hospital Emergency
Department
In 2004, one of the authors (EP) was a Vice
President for Enterprise Excellence (outside
health care, this position is often termed an
operational excellence leader) at a non-profit
private hospital, where he sought to improve
both the patient flow in the ED and the women’s mammography service lines. The hospital
was located in a wealthy south Florida community that supported the hospital through a large
foundation. The board was concerned about
reports from some wealthy benefactors that the
waiting times to see a physician in the ED were
too long. EDs are often called the “front door”

148

to the hospital, in that approximately 65% of
patients admitted to the hospital arrive via the
ED. Long wait times at various times of the day
in the ED lead to patient and family dissatisfaction, frustration by staff and the community,
and in turn may lead to reducing charitable
donations to a hospital foundation.
One of the authors (EP) was involved in the
early days of the evolution of LSS at Motorola
and had the opportunity to learn about the use
of a concept called Factory Physics™. Although
LSS was recognized as a philosophy for process
improvement and design, it was in its early days
of being utilized by hospital systems. Factory
Physics describes the “laws” that govern patient
process flow much like physics is a science
describing the “laws” that govern the forces on

physical materials in our world. Factory Physics modeling was used to improve the understanding of patient flow through the ED from
the time the physician first encountered the
patient until a decision was made as to whether
to discharge the patient to go home (“treat-tostreet” cycle time) or to admit the patient to
the hospital (“doctor-to-decision” cycle time).
In addition, the time between when a decision was made until the patient left the ED to
go home or was moved to an in-patient room
was termed the “decision-to-disposition” cycle
time. At a high level, patient demand in the ED
was addressed by representing the number of
patients presenting to the ED at each hour of
the day and at each day of the week, as shown
in FIGURE 5.1.

FIGURE 5.1 Box Plot of 2002–2005 Patient Arrivals by Hour of Day

Lean and Six Sigma Management Defined

John Tukey introduced the box-andwhiskers plot (aka box plot) as part of his
toolkit for exploratory data analysis (Tukey,
1977). The box plot is a compact distributional
summary, displaying less detail than a histogram but also taking up less space. Box plots
use robust summary statistics and actual data
points and they are easy to compute and interpret. They are especially useful for comparing
distributions across groups.
Figure 5.1 shows a box plot of patient
arrivals to this community hospital by the
hour of the day. Each box has a median line
in the box that represents the 50th percentile
(median) number of arrivals for each hour.
The bottom of the box represents the 25th percentile, and the top of the box represents the
75th percentile of patient arrivals each hour.
The distant points (outliers) outside the box
represent the range of patient arrivals each
hour, with those points that are larger than
the top of the lines extending from each box
representing outliers in the number of patient
arrivals that seldom occur but were observed
over the period of 2002–2005.
Distinct, daily patterns in patient arrivals were discovered, i.e., days of the week had
hourly arrival patterns that were similar from
week to week. Knowing the demand patterns
helps a health care administrator be better
prepared to address the demand. Some of the
emerging questions included:
1.

2.
3.
4.

5.

How does this demand pattern
support decisions and lead to
more effective staffing up- and
downstream?
What are the optimal levels of staffing to meet patient demand?
Does the nature of the demand
vary over the course of the day?
Are there certain “chief complaints”
or issues that are seen more often
during a certain time of the day or
on particular days of the week?
Does the type of staff skills needed
differ at various times of the day or
on certain days of the week?

6.

149

What should the organization do, if
anything, to be prepared to handle
the variation and demand outliers
including during mass casualty or
pandemic events?

If the organization is only staffed for the
median hourly demand, then 50% of the time,
the demand will be greater than expected. This
can contribute to increased waiting times and
dissatisfaction by patients that choose to stay
and wait. Of course, some patients may choose
to leave and go elsewhere rather than wait,
which may lead to increased patient risk and
lowered facility revenue and may undermine
the organization’s reputation.
Further, the study of time, day, and primary clinical issues of patients that were
admitted yielded information about the
demand on each floor and unit of the hospital. For example, often hospitals have rules for
discharging patients (e.g., all patients going
home on a certain day are to be discharged by
2 pm). Unfortunately, the data indicated that
the demand for beds within the hospital from
patients admitted by the ED did not synchronize with the 2 pm discharge goal. Therefore,
some units had patients in beds who were
not discharged by 2 pm, although there was a
need for these beds to relieve the congestion
in the ED. The Patient Flow Physics model
predicted the number of beds that were likely
to be needed by each unit, stratified by both
the day of the week and the time of the day.
Knowing the demand requirements for beds
in advance allowed each floor to identify the
patients most likely to go home each day and
determine which patients were likely to be discharged by each hour to meet the bed needs
of the ED. Simply put, if the flow out of each
unit at least closely approximates the flow into
each unit by day of the week and time of day,
then there should be less back-up of patients
in the ED. In turn, this allows patients to flow
smoothly into and out of the ED.
Incorporating process and flow data can
facilitate effective handling of patient demand,
utilization of resources such as staff skills, and

150

Chapter 5 Lean and Six Sigma Management

provide input as to where process improvements can be applied to reduce waiting time,
poor staff utilization, and other wasteful
aspects. Applying the Factory Physics principles to patient flow through the hospital ED
led to better-managed patient volume, better
provider and staff scheduling, and higher satisfaction among patients and care providers.

Applying LSS to Patient
Flow in Community Hospital
Mammography Service
The women’s mammography service line at
the hospital also benefited significantly. At the
beginning of the effort, the women who started
their diagnostic journey with a self-referral
mammography and were diagnosed with
cancer would find, on average, that it took 8
weeks to move through the diagnostic journey
(e.g., screening, focused mammography views,
ultrasound, biopsy, MRI) to treatment, which
may include radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery. The journey was reduced to one week or
less after detailed assessment of the process
and utilization of LSS. The significance of this
improvement cannot be understated: The earlier cancer is identified and treatment begun,
the greater the chance for improved clinical
outcomes, satisfaction, and overall quality of
life (Viau & Southern, 2007).

The Patient Flow Physics
Framework
The Patient Flow Physics framework provides a performance model that describes how
items (patients and information) flow through
a patient care process. This framework can
help improve the control and predictability of
health care operation service lines. This framework recognizes that all processes consist of:
1.
2.
3.

Demand
Transformation
Inventory

Demand is the rate at which patients present to the patient-care organization. Transformation is the activity that converts sick patients
into healthy ones or, at least, brings wellness
from illness or injury. Inventory consists of
both the supplies used for treating patients and
the patients who are waiting for the next stage
of their patient care.
Because the health care network consists
of interconnected elements, one must be able
to characterize and manage patient flows in
three different arenas:
1.
2.
3.

Flow into the patient care process
(e.g., ED or out-patient clinic);
Flow through the patient care process; and
Flow out of the patient care process.

Whether the flow is smooth or chaotic,
fast or slow, restricted or unrestricted, depends
on a range of factors internal as well as external
to the patient care process. Patient flow into
the ED is a consequence of patient flows from
emergency medical services, nursing homes,
transfers from other hospitals, direct patient
admits (referrals by outside physicians), and
walk-in patients. The patterns and sources of
patient arrivals are very important because
they critically influence the queuing effects on
the input side of the ED or, in general, of any
patient-care process.
Understanding the patterns and sources
can sometimes allow better management of
demand. For example, EDs can choose to
divert patients from emergency medical services to other EDs. Also, EDs are often utilized
by outside physicians to directly admit patients
to a hospital in-patient setting. Why does this
happen? Referring physicians recognize that
their patients will have tests associated with
admission carried out without delay (“stat”
orders) in the ED, meaning they are prioritized
and completed as soon as possible, versus the
expected delays by going to the ambulatory
clinic. Therefore, EDs could better work with
outside physicians to schedule these direct

Lean and Six Sigma Management Defined

patient admits for less busy times of the day,
thus reducing demand during peak demand
times and improving relationships with community providers.
Patients are different in the time and
resources required to manage their illnesses.
Patient flow through the ED is a function of ED
resource utilization and the variability associated with differences between ED providers.
Utilization of ED providers is of high concern.
These providers include physicians (MDs and
DOs), physician assistants (PAs), and nurse
practitioners (NPs). Another key resource
that often serves as a constraint in EDs are the
ED beds. Whenever an ED requires each new
patient to be seen in an ED bed, patients may be
waiting longer to be seen when beds are filled
with patients. Some EDs have recognized that
having ED beds as a constraint can be overcome
through seeing patients in areas without beds
where they can be assessed and treated rapidly
(FitzGerald, Jelinek, Scott, & Gerdtz, 2009).
The three-part series published in
2013–2014 called Cracking the Code: Fixing the
Crowded Emergency Department, written by
Dr. Joseph Guarisco, Chair of Emergency Services at Ochsner Health System in New Orleans, captures many of the ideas. The Ochsner
Health System uses qTrack for “quick sorting”
of patients, which protects ED beds from being
over-utilized. Some ED professionals will invoke
the rule of thumb that “vertical patients should
remain vertical, while horizontal patients
should remain horizontal,” meaning that those
patients who can walk in are vertical and are
often able to be treated while standing or sitting.
The patients who arrive via emergency medical
transport (EMT) are often in a stretcher and
should remain lying down on a bed.
Patient flow out of the ED is crucial to avoid
overly long stays in the ED. The patients who
are admitted to the hospital yet are “blocked”
from being transported to in-patient units will
remain in the ED until an in-patient unit can
accept the patient. These patients are referred
to as “ED boarded” patients. The reason ED

151

boarding arises may be due to a lack of transport
personnel, unavailability of consulting physicians (consults), and insufficient beds (either
in the hospital or perhaps destinations outside
of the hospital). Patient flow out of the ED is
an issue during winter seasons when demand
is greatest; for example, during the winter in
Florida, there is often a significant increase in
part-time residents and visitors, which may
lead to an increase in in-patient census.
Cycle times through a care process can
depend upon flow through and out of a care
process. This, of course, can be influenced by
the design of the care process. For example,
whether processes are arranged in series or
in parallel, and whether process steps serve a
useful function or exist merely because of tradition and organizational legacy.

Patient Flow and the
VUT Equation
Patient flow through and out of a patient care
process is often the focus of clinical operations. The flow into patient care processes
is impacted by the demand that operations
try to manage. The flow through patient care
processes is impacted by the utilization of key
resources (e.g., staffing levels, providers available, and room availability) to keep patients
flowing smoothly through the care processes.
The flow out of patient care processes is
impacted by both internal resources and readiness of resources outside of the current patient
care process. For example, it is more difficult
to discharge some older patients if there are
not enough skilled nursing facilities (SNF) in
the community. Likewise, limited behavioral
health program options impact the release of
patients needing those services.
In their book Factory Physics: Foundations of Manufacturing Management, Hopp &
Spearman (2008), provide the “laws that govern process flow” in manufacturing systems.
Interestingly, just as the laws of physics are those

152

Chapter 5 Lean and Six Sigma Management

BOX 5.1 VUT Equation
Average Patient Flow Care Time = Variation (V) × Utilization (U) × Process Time (T)

that define and describe motion, the principles
of process flow can also describe flow in health
care processes. One of the concepts discussed in
the book is the VUT Equation (BOX 5.1).
It is sufficient for our discussion to understand that anything that increases the variation (V), increases resource utilization (U),
or operates in processes that are designed to
take a long time (T) leads to increases in average patient flow care time. In other words, to
reduce the overall cycle time in the care of
patients requires efforts to reduce the variation
in the clinical processes, reduce utilization of
key resources (e.g., having extra capacity in
terms of resources), and optimize the inherent
process design to eliminate wasted time.
The following paragraphs describe V, U,
and T and provide examples as they relate to
patient care and flow.

Variation
Knowledge of process variation is one of
the four parts of W. Edwards Deming’s
System of Profound Knowledge (Deming,
1993, pp. 98–99):
Variation there will always be, between
people, in output, in service, and in
product. What is the variation trying to tell us about a process, and
about the people who work in it? .... A
process may be in statistical control or
it may not be. In the state of statistical control, the variation to expect in
the future is predictable. Costs, performance, quality, and quantity are
predictable. [Walter] Shewhart called
this the stable state. If the process is
not stable, then it is unstable. Its performance is not predictable.

Variation is either common or special.
Common cause variation can be the routine
patient census number increases and decreases
across hours, days, and seasons. Special cause
variation is not random, and it can be assigned
to special events or circumstances such as with
extremely high patient count in an ED due to
a major, mass casualty event. It could also be
attributed to an increase in medical errors due
to new equipment failures.
Causes of variation in data can be detected
with control charts, which are run charts (or
time series graphs) that incorporate upper
and lower control (sigma) lines (see Chapter
4 and examples later in the chapter). There are
eight universally accepted decision rules that
are applied to detect extreme points from the
mean, trends, and the unusual patterns that are
low probability events. Wheeler (2000) prefers
the name process behavior charts because it
better describes the variation as the “voice of
the process.” These charts can help distinguish
between routine, always occurring “noise” vs.
“signals” that are hopefully less frequent indications of some special cause variation. Finally,
data and variation can only be understood
in the context in which they were collected
(Hesselink et al., 2013). More specifically, the
analysis must be applied to a specific process;
individual or group; period of time; or the use
of specific material or equipment. This latter
point is critical and often misunderstood.
Control charts must use rational sampling and rational subgrouping to produce
valid results (Wheeler, 1995). Selection of
the time and data must be consistent and
based on logic. When data collection is properly conducted, the three sigma limits and
within-group variation will help identify legitimate process “signals.” The goal of rational

Lean and Six Sigma Management Defined

subgrouping is to identify differences between
short- and longer-term process variation at
single points in time. The variables that effect
variation are random if there were no deliberate changes to the process. Purposeful modifications could include staffing changes, new
devices or equipment, such as more bronchoscopes or surgical microscopes, or the introduction of new treatment protocols, etc. If data
are regularly collected and analyzed, staff will
more likely know “what is different.”
Jensen and Mayer (2015) propose the
terms natural and artificial variation. Natural
variation is commonly occurring and due to
chance, bias, or an artifact in data collection.
Variation is natural and it is going to happen.
It cannot be eliminated but it can be managed. On the other hand, artificial variation
“is neither necessary nor random. It is driven
by largely unknown, ignored, or unchallenged
priorities.” It is like the self-inflicted wound
of scheduling elective surgeries during busy,
prime hours.
Variation can be attributed to:
■

Demand for patient flow into the processes
Differences in patient needs (e.g., ambulatory vs. handicapped, older vs. younger)
Differences in how care is delivered by
clinical staff
Reliability of patient care and handoffs to
avoid errors, and rework
Availability of resources outside current
patient care processes (e.g., rehabilitation,
assisted living or skilled nursing facilities,
family support, and in-patient care units)

Hospital management seeks to find ways
to understand variation in demand, patient
care processing, and readiness of rate limiting
resources to which patients are flowing out of
the patient care process. We have found the
following observations about managing variation to be helpful.
Learn the patterns of demand. Although
demand of clinical processes can vary significantly from day to day or within a day,

153

there are tools, including run charts, control
charts, and box plots, that can lead to a better
understanding of demand variation in terms
of when it may occur and how much variation it can cause. For example, grocery stores
use forecasts to manage inventory along with
staffing matched to demand. Some stores
will provide extra capacity by having enough
check-out lanes for each hour in a day for
each day of the week. They also call “all baggers” to the front when lines start forming.
And just as grocery stores know the customer
demand by day of week and hour of day, in
EDs, Mondays will look like other Mondays,
Tuesdays like other Tuesdays, and so forth.
Dave Eitel, an emergency medicine physician who co-created the Emergency Services
Index Triage protocols, would often say that
he knew the typical patient that was coming
to the ED, but just did not know their name
(AHRQ, 2012). Eitel recommended that EDs
adopt grocery store practices for forecasting peaks and valleys in demand and adjust
capacity accordingly.
Standardize care for typical patients.
Clinical practice variation can be addressed
through some form of standardization as discussed later in this chapter in LMS practices.
Health care systems often use standard order
sets to address the 80/20 rule, where 80% of
the patients presenting with known conditions can be handled with a basic order set.
For example, although patients that visit an
ED may be unique, experienced providers will
recognize that most of these patients present
a similar patient pattern, and standard order
sets can be used effectively. The care for these
“typical” patients will therefore be more consistent and standardized. The patients presenting with unusual conditions or an unusual
manifestation of these conditions can then be
addressed with extra attention or with different procedures.
Standardization of activities is also an
effective way to reduce variation by ensuring that staff perform the same duties in the

154

Chapter 5 Lean and Six Sigma Management

same preferred ways. Only best practices are
standardized so this also increases quality.
According to Imai (2012, pp. 54–55), “standards represent the best, easiest, and safest way
to do a job.” They also preserve organizational
knowledge and expertise and facilitate valid
measurement of organizational performance.
Standards can also help clarify cause and effect
relationships and expedite maintenance and
improvement.
Put population data to work. Population
health analytics allows tailoring the management approach for various patient demographics and conditions thus reducing the
practice variation and lessening the time
needed to address each patient’s needs. This
knowledge can be readily applied to disease
management.
Learn from other organizations dealing
with high variability. High-reliability organizations (HROs) have characteristics that
parallel many features of the health care environments (i.e., EDs, operating rooms, intensive
care units, etc.), including the use of complex
technologies, a fast-paced tempo of operations, and a high level of risk, yet they manifest spectacularly low error rates (Sanchez &
Barach, 2012). HROs are required to respond
to a wide variety of situations under changing
environmental conditions in a reliable and
consistent way. Examples of HROs include
aircraft carriers, nuclear power plants, and
firefighting teams. Weick and Sutcliffe (2001)
have studied these industries and found that
they share an extraordinary capacity to discover and manage unexpected events resulting in exceptional safety and consistent levels
of performance despite a fast-changing external environment. HRO methodologies and
practices can offer clinical care with greater
patient safety, less process rework, improved
patient outcomes, and greater patient satisfaction (Oster & Braaten, 2016; Tamuz &
Harrison, 2006).

Create buffers. Buffer management is an
effective approach for reducing and mitigating the negative aspects of excessive and/or
uncontrolled variation. Buffers are like shock
absorbers on cars. Instead of reducing bumps
in the road for a car, buffers reduce or dampen
the effect of variability when trying to synchronize demand to transformation (Pound,
Bell, & Spearman, 2014, p. 51). There are time,
capacity, and inventory buffers. Time buffers
include waiting times and extra available time
that can be used. Capacity buffers are the numbers of staff, beds, and equipment that can be
used to treat patients. Inventory buffers can be
supplies or patients’ waiting for the next step in
a process. Buffers must be properly managed,
and they cannot be too large. Patients do not
like to wait and unused capacity and inventory
costs money. The creative use of buffers can
greatly reduce patient length of stay. A family practitioner liked to spend extra time with
certain patients to socialize. Unfortunately,
this usually altered the carefully constructed
patient schedule. He did not want to give up
this “special” time so it was suggested that he
see those patients just before his lunch break
or at the end of the day. It proved an effective
compromise.

Utilization
Utilization refers to the use of resources. Utilization without any waste or nonvalue-added
activities is an “efficient” process (see the previous Muri discussion). These resources are
more technically referred to as “capacity.” Utilization is impacted by:
■
■

■

Available staffing capacity each hour to
handle variation in demand
Availability of resources such as computer
systems, beds/treatment rooms, equipment in imaging/labs, and transportation
Sufficient availability of inventory such as
blood, medications, medical devices including stents/splints, transport equipment, or
patients ready for the next procedure

Lean and Six Sigma Management Defined

■
■
■

Financial resources to access services
The time to complete clinical and administrative activities
Resources for training and other staff
development

This “capacity” must be available across
the basic value stream (FIGURE 5.2) and at each
step of the microlevel processes.
When the population does not have
adequate and effective prevention services,
they can develop serious health conditions
that require secondary or tertiary treatment.
Families without health insurance tend to use
more expensive ED services because they cannot access ambulatory and out-patient care.
A lack of in-patient beds contributes to ED
boarding, as does limited availabilty of SNFs.
Inadequate staffing levels adds to length of stay
and decreases the quality of patient care. Both
under and over-utilization of resources can be
problematic.
Capacity issues, poor process design, and/
or unsatisfactory staff performance contribute
to process bottlenecks which are the slowest
activity steps. One way to address capacity is
to build in “slack” as “a cushion of actual or
potential resources which allows an organization to adapt successfully to internal pressures
for adjustment or to external pressures for
change in policy as well as to initiate changes
in strategy…” (Lawson, 2001, pp. 125–131).
Slack is uncommitted staff, space, and equipment. It is the antidote for the “myth of 100%
efficiency.” First, if people are always busy with
regular work duties, they have no flexibility or
time for reflecting, thinking, planning, training, or quality improvement (DeMarco, 2001).
CQI projects require staff time and resources.
Busy staff resent these projects being dumped

on their already “full plates” (Barach &
Kleinman, 2018).
Experienced hospital executives know
that ED boarding tends to increase when
in-patient bed usage exceeds 80%. The Toyota
Production System (TPS) has been the very
effective model for many LMS turnaround
initiatives in hospitals systems like Virginia
Mason (Kenney, 2010). TPS frees up time for
quality by empowering workers to “fix” errors
when they occur, even if it slows down or
stops “the line.” They have lower manager- and
supervisor-to-staff ratios, which aids in problem solving and coaching. They also take more
time to plan new products and services to
“get it right,” thus saving significant resources
before production and delivery commences.
There are many ways to keep utilization of
key resources low:
1.

2.

3.

Keeping key resources such as providers and beds in an ED utilized
less than 80% of the time allows for
better management of demand and
enables the system to address more
effectively variation in patient flow
(see Muri discussed previously);
Understanding variation in demand
and patients will allow for better
scheduling of people resources (see
Mura discussed previously); and
Applying box plots of variation as
explained earlier in this chapter
allows for determining the 75th
percentile of demand and process
variation so that adjusting scheduling to meet the demands of the 75th
percentile will lessen the impact of
overall process demand and minimize flow variation.

Chapter 5 Lean and Six Sigma Management

Time
Slow and inefficient health care processes
negatively impact patient satisfaction. Management dictates that “time is money.” More
importantly, slow treatment can contribute
to poor health outcomes. Time includes the
activities or tasks within each step and the
space between steps. Delays can occur during
handoffs and transitions; departmental or
functional group boundaries can also contribute to these “white space” management challenges (Rummler & Brache, 1995).
The cancer screening mammography
example discussed earlier in the chapter
illustrates the impact that the passing time
has on the effectiveness of the process. Each
step in the diagnostic journey for cancer
screening (e.g., initial screening, additional
digital imaging, ultrasound, MRI, biopsy, surgical treatment, oncological treatment) may
be well-defined and managed. However, the
time between steps may be increased due to
the unplanned or poorly managed transitions
between each step. If an initial screening mammography is completed and no “suspicious”
areas of the breast are observed, then the process may stop. If a suspicious area in the mammography is observed, then the provider may
either ask the patient to stay longer for additional imaging or, for those providers who do
not read the initial imaging in real time while
the patient is there, the patient’s primary care
physician may receive a report later indicating
more work-up is needed. The patient is contacted and requested to make an appointment
for a follow-up visit with either the primary
care physician or the mammography center,
or both. Therefore, the transition from initial screening imaging and follow-up imaging
may have wait times built in that can increase
patient anxiety. Furthermore, delay may allow
time for ongoing growth of a cancerous tumor.
In 1915, Gilbreth used time motion studies to show convincingly that the actual time
needed to complete a process, such as imaging, reading the results, and determining

the next clinical steps, may be short relative
to the time spent between steps (Gilbreth &
Gilbreth, 2002). Reducing transition time
between steps (i.e., eliminating wait time) is
often worthwhile in reducing patient anxiety,
determining clinical concerns earlier, perhaps reducing the effort needed for treatment
if caught earlier, and honoring the patient’s
personal time. It is not unusual for transition
times to be increased for the convenience
of the providers, other staff, the facilities in
which patients are seen, and to complete
documentation consistent with regulatory or
compliance requirements. Putting the patient
first (beyond paying lip service) takes significant effort and may be a challenge to the “way
things are done here.”
Time is also defined by the process:
■

■

The design of a patient care process can
determine the minimal amount of time a
patient will spend, flow through, and out
of a process if there were no impediments
or variation in the process.
Addition of nonvalue-added steps in
the process that only adds time, potentially increases variation, and increased
opportunity for errors. For example, in an
empty ED, are all patients required to go
through a separate step called “triage,” or
can they immediately proceed directly to
being seen by a provider?

We have learned by managing dozens of
clinical projects that finding ways to reduce
the length of time spent in the patient flow care
process may require staff to:
1.

2.

Eliminate or reduce nonvalueadded process tasks or steps such
as unnecessary waiting times. The
longer the process, the more things
can go wrong for patients and the
more costs for the system.
Implement LMS (see discussion
that follows) to draw attention to
time spent on identifying and reducing nonvalue-added process steps.

Lean Management System (LMS)

3.

Create value-stream managers that
control all the resources needed for
their service lines (i.e., ICU patients,
hip repairs, etc.). This reduces
boundary or interface issues.

It is not coincidental that the philosophies
and practices of CQI as espoused by Six Sigma,
LMS, and LSS, all lead to reducing variation
in processes and overutilization of resources
as well as streamlining patient flow care processes, leading to reduced time to care. In the
next part of this chapter, we provide an overview of the principles of LMS.

▸

Lean Management
System (LMS)

The VUT equation described is a relatively
simple model to understand, but it is more
challenging to implement. LMS models provide for an effective system to optimize process
management as suggested by the VUT equation. The active joining of these two models
will be discussed later. Specifically, managers
and their staff need to direct and set examples
about required behaviors to reduce or manage
variation, maximize human and equipment
utilization, and decrease process cycle times.
First, a comparison is in order. If a Lean
organization is like an automobile, then the
engine is similar to the organization’s capacity to provide services and the transmission
is anologous to a LMS. The transmission
sends power to the wheel axel to move the
vehicle forward. It also changes gears to better match power and resource demands. An
automatic transmission smooths these shifts
and helps reduce variation. An organization’s
LMS coordinates resources and directs them
to efficiently satisfy customer work orders
(demands). When managers apply the “right”
tools, this stimulus and response situation can
be virtually seamless.
Management in Lean organizations
has “two major functions: maintaining or

controlling the existing processes, and improving existing processes” (Charron, Harrington,
Voehl, & Wiggin, 2015, p. 1). Performance
management occurs through continuous
improvement, and emphasizes staff development, socio-technical (belief) systems, and
change management. High performing companies are paying increasingly more attention
to organizational culture that focuses on reliability and safety (Weick & Roberts, 1993).
Organizational goal success can seem
entirely random without effective management. On some days, the production might be
successful, and on others it will produce near
misses and process failures. Management and
front line staff will not know when or why either
will occur. This is akin to employees starting
each day with the important question, “Do I feel
lucky?” This mode of operation is very stressful and costly, and one never feels in control
of their processes or environment because so
much of the output is ruled by chance.
LMS approaches have been successfully
applied in hundreds of organizations and
two prominent examples in health care are
at Virginia Mason and Baylor, Scott & White
(BS&W). A recent book, The Power of Ideas to
Transform Healthcare: Engaging Staff by Building Daily Lean Management Systems by Steve
Hoeft and Robert W. Pryor (2016), thoroughly
documents the BS&W Lean journey. The
authors credit the successful LMS implementation to the continuous implementation of
staff-generated ideas. Lean management is the
vehicle for this staff engagement and the continuous infusion of suggestions successfully
implemented in both the clinics and administrative activities. The basic principles apply
across the board in both health care services
and manufacturing (Hoeft & Pryor, 2016).
A more in-depth treatment can be found
in Mann (2015) where he shows how it can
become even more powerful when attention is
devoted to organizational culture.
The LMS model shown in FIGURE 5.3

interconnections and overlaps between the
three components. Everything begins with the
Leader Standard Work, because that is where
supervision through executive activities and
the standardization of the processes of the
other elements are spelled out. For example,
how do leaders select and maintain the data
in Visual Controls (see the following sections),
how is their Daily Accountability (see the following sections) implemented, and how are
staff held to account on a regular basis.
The three interconnected variables of
leader standard work, visual controls, and
daily accountability are influenced by the
important factor of discipline. Discipline and
stable leadership are needed to ensure that
long term success and flow are maximized
at the juncture where important parts of the
model align.
The Toyota Production System argues
that organizational culture can change through
the inculcation of principles delineated in
the Four P Model (Liker & Ross, 2017, p. 48)
and include:

Philosophy of long-term focus

Staff must be allowed to devote time to
completely understand and reflect on their
work activities in order to identify waste and
standardize best practices. To understand variation in one’s work flow, one must carefully
review multiple data points. Ideally, at least 20
data points are needed for a significant “minimum” trend, but a minimum of seven data
points should be used when tracking seasonal
changes that are so crucial for health care planning (Balestracci, 2015). When more data is
available, it is easier to differentiate between
common- and special-cause variation.
Lean management is a very hands-on
activity requiring supervisors and line managers to actively apply these principles on the
work floor or “gemba.” They cannot manage
this from their offices while reviewing data
or reports and answering emails. This begins
with Leader Standard Work.

Leader Standard Work
LMS does not assume that employees, including managers and leaders, know what they are
supposed to do. Best practices or standards are
clearly spelled out in detail and often posted
in activity areas. Common examples include
hand washing directions in rest rooms or
graphical safety directions for using dangerous
equipment. These best practices are updated
as new standards and improvements are made.
A lack of standardized work increases
variation and can produce very strange data
distributions. Variation is a key element in the
VUT equation. Different types of patients or
invoices require specialized “handling” and
will require multiple methods and changeovers, etc. This tends to reduce cycle time. On
the other hand, a generalized approach can
restrict flow and slow down processes. The following LMS tables (see TABLE 5.1, TABLE 5.2, and
TABLE 5.3) have been adapted from Creating a

Lean Management System (LMS)

Lean Culture (Mann, 2015, pp. 58–59). The
three tables are divided to show the frequency
of application and levels within the organization. Note that the supervisors or team leaders
repeat tasks more frequently than managers
or directors. They also do not have the same
responsibilities and there is no universal application of this approach across the organization.
Supervisors and managers “go to the
gemba” or where the work is done on the shop
floor—or in the clinical context, the operating
room, the intensive care unit, or the ED, many
times every day (Imai, 2012). They observe,
listen and question. Staff are encouraged and
rewarded to speak up and find simple solutions (kaizens) to improve the value work
stream. Staff are coached and developed in an

159

apprentice model. Working with staff, managers assist in removing barriers, search for ways
to improve flow capacity, and reduce process
variation, capacity restraints, and cycle time.
This direct contact between management
and frontline workers builds trust, and provides opportunities for much learning, data
collection, and problem identification before
it is filtered by middle management. Managers
can directly observe how buffers are managed
to ensure that patients, transactions and information are being effectively used. They can
directly observe staff (and machines) working
at a manageable pace or breakneck speed? Is
there any “slack” that can be used in positive
ways? Finally, standard work is monitored and
modified on the production line (floor) as

different work methods can be a leading cause
of process variation.
Many more activities such as huddles
occur daily. These short staff meetings at the
beginning of each shift employ a very data
driven approach to planning and problem solving. Key management data are displayed on a
wall that is convenient for staff to view during
the daily huddles. Huddles will be addressed
more completely in the Daily Accountability
Section (later in the chapter).
Staffing levels, equipment and inventory
are checked because that also impacts capacity.
Supervisors and managers should also briefly
review the day’s work before going home and
especially consider visiting the hospital on
weekends where they can help focus on work
that can prevent excessive harm on weekends (Shulkin, 2008). Directors and hospital
administrators should also go to the gemba
or “rounds” at least once a day in one of their
many areas or locations (Saposnik, 2007).
This helps managers understand the value
streams and their regular presence motivates
staff to stay focused and continuously improve
(Bendavid et al., 2007).

These activities are less frequent but no
less important. Note the importance of regular champion meetings to address ongoing improvement needs. These weekly or
biweekly staff meetings are longer, sit-down
events that communicate important organizational changes, deal with near miss or process failures, etc. Discussions can also be more
in-depth, but this is not time for microlevel
problem solving. That can be assigned to people to handle outside the meeting and report
back. Finally, senior leaders need to regularly
review strategic plan implementation.

Visual Controls
Visual controls in Lean management should
always begin with some type of “as is” value
stream or process map. This provides an
important context and a reference point for
any discussion of related metrics or issues.

Lean Management System (LMS)

help clinicians clarify through visualization
what they know about their environment and
determine what they want to improve about
it (Barach & Johnson, 2006). The process
maps use common flowchart symbols and
can describe the current state or baseline, the
improved state in transition, and the optimal state. The exercise helps clinicians make
assumptions and expectations explicit and can
provide insights into reflections on their current state and, importantly, into how to improve
the process of care or to overcome barriers they
perceive to its improvement (Johnson et al.,
2012). The numbered steps facilitate an honest
discussion and the process efficiency times are
a useful ratio for assessing what is value-added
time versus nonvalue-added timed activities
(Hollingsworth et al., 1998).
An important part of a LMS is “learning
to see” what is happening in the value stream
or process. The visual display of the right data
facilitates this awareness and is crucial because
measurement influences behavior. In this
approach, the “right” data focuses attention on
variation, utilization/capacity, and time (VUT).
Clinical microsystems should monitor and
analyze no more than four to five key performance indicators (KPIs) because staff focus can
easily be distracted and overwhelmed (Mohr,
Bataden, Barach, 2004). Ideal health care metrics might include the cycle time, patient wait
times, medical errors, scheduling errors, patient
volumes, provider volumes, and takt times.
Takt is the German word for the baton
that an orchestra conductor uses to regulate
the tempo of the music. In Lean, takt time is
the rate at which a finished product needs to be
completed in order to meet customer demand,
and patient satisfaction, etc. (Rother, 2010).
The data collection should include important
variables such as types of patients, providers,
and errors.
Every metric selected should include a
numerical target and these need to be “stretch
goals” to help motivate improvements. You
may also collect data for the important
parts of the clinical process such as times

163

for door-to-doctor; doctor-to-decision; and
decision-to-disposition. This enables stratification or the necessary “drilling down” into the
datasets to find specific answers to the many
important management questions.
It is important that an appropriate sampling plan be developed, as described in
Chapter 4 and throughout the CQI evolution,
including the earliest work of Deming. There
are various approaches that can be used to
select primary data for CQI processes (Perla,
Provost, & Murray, 2013). For many organizations, the management metrics used to understand and manage work processes are often
based on averages rather than understanding
actual variation in processes (Kim, Spahlinger,
Kin, & Billi, 2006). For example, the length
of stay (LOS) is often reported as an average
length of stay (ALOS) and resource utilization is also reported in averages, etc. This
would be adequate if the data did not fluctuate much around the average. As previously
stated, patient demand tends to vary hour to
hour, day to day, and seasonally, while patient
conditions can also markedly differ. How do
we better manage and ultimately improve our
health care processes?
Ideally, the data would be automatically
collected by the electronic health record
(EHR) or another database aligned throughout the organization. This produces a synergistic effect of added value. “Like magnetism,
alignment is a force. It coalesces and focuses
an organization and moves it forward”
(Labowski & Rosansky, 1997, p. 6).
The data points need to be collected for
every patient or transaction for any desired
time period. The data needs to be easily
exported into a standard data format that
facilitates data analysis. Unfortunately, this is
not the current reality in most organizations,
as process data (e.g., waiting time, variation
in test and treatment order sets among physicians, real-time utilization of key resources,
errors or near-miss causes, etc.) are often not
tracked or readily available in the IT applications used in clinical processes. Instead, the

164

Chapter 5 Lean and Six Sigma Management

data tracked in the IT systems are related to
activity transactions per patient such as orders
made and fulfilled, tests or procedures applied,
and medications administered, etc.
The huddle board design template
(FIGURE 5.5) was successfully implemented at
a large health care revenue cycle management
organization. Some data examples will follow
later. Each team constructed their own board
and creative differences were encouraged. It
was important to display the current process
map for quick reference and context. Finally,
each team posted a list of what their successful
outcomes would contribute to the next downstream group in the value stream. For example, chart recovery staff had time and accuracy
goals to expedite coding. This helped employees understand how they contributed to the
“big picture.” Suneja and Suneja (2010) use the
term “Glass Wall” for the same concept.

The top row contains trends for the
macro level KPIs that are aligned to the highest level of the organization. Where appropriate, the metrics should include mandated
core measures such as patient satisfaction or
median length of stay. The run chart shown in
FIGURE 5.6 is an example of a displayed metric
on the huddle board.
A quick glance at the trend reveals
nonrandom patterns, including what some
authors define as “astronomical” data points
(i.e., the two unusually large values at 10:00 am
and 12:00 am) (Perla, Provost, & Murray, 2011).
Unfortunately, explanations are not apparent.
These warrant further analysis using other
CQI tools; the analysis methodology and these
CQI tools are presented below and described
further in Chapter 4. This leads to the second
row on the huddle board, where “drilldowns”
or stratification charts can be displayed.

graph looks at how much time ED physicians
take from when then they first talk to their
patients to the time when they make their clinical decisions. Box plots provide an interesting
perspective on managing variation in care.
A quick glance at Figure 5.8 shows that
the physicians labeled #12214, 11288, and
12215 are spending relatively more time with
their patients than physicians labeled #139,
309, 378, 11215, 11082, 12214, and 13179. The
physicians labeled #13159, 13259, and 13179
had a wider range of times to come to their
decisions. This time data is important because
it impacts both utilization (capacity) and process time. It would be important to drill down
and compare physician times across common
patient type variables such as chief complaints
or diagnostic related groups (DRG).
How can the information in a box plot
be used to understand variation (V in the
VUT equation)? When comparing attending
ED physicians, patient LOS in the ED can be
measured before they are ultimately admitted
to an in-patient room at a hospital. If we only

These charts can be tacked under each highlevel chart from the first row and can be presented in a chronological “pile” that can be
easily explored. Appropriate charts include
Pareto charts for medical errors/harm and
controls charts for both trended errors and
process times (Johnson & Barach, 2017). A
typical control chart can be seen in FIGURE 5.7.
The XbarR charts in Figure 5.7 displays the
means (Xbar) of each sub-group (solid lines).
The dashed lines represent different standard
deviation levels. In these control charts, four
patients were tracked at the beginning of each
hour in the initial door-to-doctor phase of an
ED redesign process. This is in-between group
variation, and there are some obvious special
cause outliers and other patterns (see Chapter 4 for further description of special cause
variation). The accompanying range (R) chart
in Figure 5.7 shows the corresponding within
group variation.
Box plots (FIGURE 5.8) are great graphical
tools for comparing distributions of variable
data such as time passed and costs of care. This

FIGURE 5.8 Box Plot for Physicians to Assess Their Decision Times

compare patients who are admitted with respiratory distress related issues (e.g., flu, pneumonia) then it is expected that although there may
be outliers in LOS, in general the middle 50% of
the patients admitted for respiratory reasons by
different physicians should be similar. Rather
than looking at the exceptions as represented
by outliers outside the boxes, compare the size
of the boxes representing the amount of variation in the middle 50% of the LOS data. It is
reasonable to expect similar results between
physicians for the middle 50%. If the variation
in the LOS for these physicians is quite different, then the natural question is what might be
causing the variation in outcomes. The reasons
may include physicians ordering more tests
and treatments than their colleagues which
may result in longer LOS for their patients.
Some physicians may either use standard order
sets or have a very well-defined process for
handling respiratory challenged patients, hence
they are more consistent in their LOS results.
Rather than challenging staff to explain to
others the reason for differences in variation,
it is better to provide staff with the information in a graphical format and let them discuss
it among themselves. Having variation data

displayed with box plots is useful as it is easy
to understand if applied on a regular basis
and often sparks dialogue among providers to
understand why variation is occurring.
A Pareto chart (first introduced in
Chapter 4) is a powerful tool to help graphically illustrate variation, as illustrated in
FIGURE 5.9.
It is obvious in Figure 5.9 that some providers need to sign their charts before the
charts can be coded and billed. Missing signatures accounted for 71% of the sampled
errors. A second level Pareto analysis can
drill down to show which providers are the
primary offenders. Knowing the “real” times
to complete documentation or see patients
provides essential information for improving
the process.
If “production” is one of the first row KPIs,
then pitch charts (FIGURE 5.10) can be used to
track work output during specific periods of
time against goals. Examples of production
might include numbers of tests completed in the
lab, images read by radiologists, or charts coded
during revenue cycle management (RCM).
The chart can also be modified to add an
individual worker column. These charts can

could also be used for the reds and greens.

capacity, both important aspects of the VUT
equation. Managers must successfully juggle
patient volume (demand) with staff availability. These two trend lines can easily show what
capacity existed during that reporting time
period given the varying patient demands.
Was there adequate coverage later in the day?
What happened to the patient length of stay
after 10:00?
Staff suggestions are an important part
of continuous quality improvement and they
should be tracked and posted on the board
(FIGURE 5.13). The similar companion chart for
supervisors can also be maintained and displayed because the staff deserve responses and
tracking increases action.
Traffic light colors make it “easier to see”
(unless someone is color blind!). Line graphs
could also be used to display this data over
time (FIGURE 5.14).

Daily Accountability
Daily accountability is the most interactive
part of the LMS model. Management actively
engages with staff when they “go to the gemba”
and during huddles (Ben-Tovim et al., 2007).
This can also include regular follow-up

discussions on clinical improvement projects.
Gemba walks are at the core of Lean practice.
Going to “where the work occurs” is the best
place to collect real time data. This happens
when supervisors and managers observe, listen, challenge and question each other. We
want the staff to think and derive the growth
and satisfaction that comes from their own
problem solving efforts. We want them to
actively “see” what is happening and actively
engage their colleagues to look for waste. The
simple tool shown in TABLE 5.4 can help this
exploration.
This list of waste types enables managers to remember what to look for and
reminds them to record brief observations and
improvement ideas (Fine, Golden, Hannam, &
Morra, 2009). Managers should ask the same
four questions during gemba walks:
1.
2.
3.
4.

What are your team’s targets or
goals today?
How well are you meeting these
targets (facts)?
What is your plan or planned actions
to close the performance gap?
How can I help you implement
your ideas?

How to Improve

Conclusions

The Huddle Board examples shown in
FIGURE 5.15 and FIGURE 5.16 are the focus of
brief, 10- to 15-minute, stand-up meetings that
might involve different staff at different levels.
They address more than just the exchange of
important shift change information or communication “from above.” This is an opportunity to briefly review the highlights of KPI
data and to focus on both positive and negative variation. Why did that data point increase

FIGURE 5.15 Huddle Board Example 1

(or decrease)? What explains the trend? Write
comments on the charts, involve staff in these
discussions, and have them all take turns leading the huddles. Encourage staff to come back
and think about the data. Assignments can be
given for later report backs and good facilitation is imperative.
Coaching is another important piece of
daily accountability because it is the preferred
way to development staff and improve accountability (Sherrard, Trypuc, & Hudson, 2009).
Managers must respect their workers to be effective coaches. This is accomplished by asking
staff how something should be done as opposed
to just telling them the correct way to complete
a task. Coaches model appropriate behaviors
and use shaping and modeling to help staff
perfect new skills. Shaping involves reinforcing
each successive approximation until mastery is
achieved. Incorrect behaviors are corrected but
that can be initiated by asking the worker if the
task was completed correctly. If they acknowledge the error, then the follow-up question can
be “How would you improve it?”
Continuing to engage staff and attentively listening to the staff suggestions are the
most important output of daily accountability
meetings. This “sense-making” is a huge part
of engendering trust, accountability and organizational loyalty (Barach & Phelps, 2013).
Empowering staff jump starts creative problem
solving. Observing and questioning also facilitates critical thinking. This on-going generation of staff ideas is important that the number
of suggestions made and implemented should
be recorded and tracked on the huddle board.
Management responses and follow-up should
also be posted.

Conclusions

Lean Management Systems (LMS) and Lean Six
Sigma (LSS) offer an approach, a set of tools,
and a way of thinking about how to more effectively assess and study clinical flow, including
addressing variation in process and operations.

172

Chapter 5 Lean and Six Sigma Management

These methodologies are widely applicable in
studying and improving quality and efficiency
of health processes spanning health care, public health and other settings. A particular LSS
example illustrated in this chapter is an application to the Patient Flow Physics Framework.
It illustrates that improvement requires an
understanding of the patient care process flows
(e.g., process maps or flow charts), the factors
that drive variation in the process, resource utilization impacts on the process, and the relationships of patient care flow cycle times are
impacted by poor or inefficient process design.

Improving clinical teamwork is an important factor in improving patient outcomes. In
fact, it is a requirement for effective use of the
tools described in this chapter. Indeed, quality improvement efforts are not about which
tools are used but about how these tools can
produce insight, engage the team members,
and track patient progress. Their purpose is
to help people function as a team, as well as
to improve patient outcomes. The importance
of teamwork in LMS and LSS as well as other
CQI initiatives and methods will be discussed
further in Chapter 6.

CHAPTER 6

Understanding and
Improving Team
Effectiveness in Quality
Improvement
Bruce Fried
There is no substitute for teamwork and good
leaders of teams to bring consistency of effort
along with knowledge.
— W. Edwards Deming

T

eams play a major part in all aspects of
health care. In quality improvement,
the team is the primary vehicle through
which problems are analyzed, solutions are
generated, and changes evaluated. Effective
teamwork is a key factor influencing the diffusion and successful implementation of quality
improvement (QI) in health care.
In this chapter, brief case studies are used
to illustrate the potential of teams for fostering improvement in organizations and the
problems encountered when teams are poorly
organized. CASE STUDY 6.1 illustrates both
the positive and negative potential of teams.

State University Hospital (SUH) sought to
assemble an integrated, multidepartmental
team to address a complex problem involving many organizational components that
rarely interacted in a concerted, coordinated
manner. Each department had developed
systems addressing end-of-life records and
documentation for its own processes. However, because these were not integrated with
other departments’ systems, all departments
experienced problems that were badly compounded by an unpredicted environmental
change brought to light by State Donor Services (SDS). In its initial attempt to address
the organ donation problem, the team was
given inadequate time to get organized, leading to a production schedule that was unrealistic. The tight time frame did not provide
adequate time to determine the composition of the team. Several members lacked
175

176

Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement

CASE STUDY 6.1: STATE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
AND STATE DONOR SERVICES
State Donor Services (SDS) centrally manages the state’s organ procurement and donation process.
There had been a trend of declining organ availability for transplant, despite efforts to increase
awareness and success in registering donors through the Division of Motor Vehicles. To help solve the
problem, SDS approached State University Hospital (SUH), one of the biggest sources of and utilizers
of donated organs through its renowned organ transplant programs. Initial exploration of the problem
quickly indicated a consistent demand for organs, but organ donations at SUH were down, matching
the pattern seen by SDS.
Chris Carter, the new administrator for SUH’s emergency department, was asked to build a team
to solve this problem for SUH. The hospital’s Chief Operating Officer (COO) told Chris that this was a
top priority because of the high visibility of the transplant programs, the revenues it brought to the
institution, and the fact that the Chairman of Surgery had just threatened to leave the institution if SUH
“didn’t fix this problem it had obviously created.” The COO gave Chris 2 weeks to get a team together
and develop a solution, which Chris would present at SUH’s monthly Executive Committee meeting.
Chris asked the COO for advice regarding whom to have on the team, and the COO referred him to the
Chief Nursing Officer (CNO).
Chris went immediately to the CNO, but the first available meeting time she had was in 3 days. In
the meantime, Chris gathered as much information as possible. On the third day, the CNO’s secretary
called to cancel the meeting but suggested that he talk with the Nursing Division Director for Medicine.
She met with Chris that afternoon, and together, they formulated a list of people they thought would
be able to address the issue. SUH was a functionally structured organization, so they built a team
with nursing directors from each of the transplant services and the emergency department, the
Director of Patient Care Services, a clerk, a physician from the emergency room, and the State Medical
Examiner—whose office was located at SUH and who was responsible for autopsies—as well as a clerk
from his office.
The earliest possible meeting time for this group was in 3 weeks— well beyond the COO’s
deadline. Nonetheless, Chris set up a meeting with as many team members as possible and met
with the others individually. The team would be able to meet only once or perhaps twice given the
aggressive deadline and members’ schedules.
Fearing the approaching deadline and wanting to waste no time, Chris got right to business
when the group met. He told the group his goals and invited an open discussion of each team
member’s experiences with organ procurement. It quickly became evident that several members of
the team were too new or too junior to be helpful, with some of Chris’s invitees having asked more
junior colleagues to be a part of the team in their stead. The Medical Examiner immediately called
into question the validity of the group and the authority by which he had been called to this meeting.
When Chris told him this was a high-priority project for the COO and CNO—stating only their names
and not their titles—the Medical Examiner indignantly replied that he had never heard of these people
and that this was a waste of his time. When Chris clarified their titles, the Medical Examiner became
less vocal, but remained indignant. He had been focused on solving a problem of declining autopsies,
which placed SUH at risk of violating a state regulation. He was angry to have been diverted from this
pressing problem and felt that Chris’s group would draw organizational focus and energies away from
his own needs. His resentment spread to others in the group, which, coupled with their inexperience
and a lack of appropriate representation, rendered the meeting—and the group—effectively useless.
In an effort to avoid a public display of this disaster, Chris reported his lack of success to the COO
prior to the Executive Committee meeting. The COO realized the impossibility of the goals he had
set for Chris. He extended the deadline 3 months and also utilized his own authority by agreeing to

Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement

177

attend the next team meeting. These two key factors allowed Chris to rebuild a more knowledgeable,
representative, and experienced team.
Ultimately, the organ donation problem was traced to a series of new federal regulations and
SUH’s fragmented approach to processing end-of-life paperwork. In summary, each operational unit
had established its own processes for responding to the regulatory requirements, none of which were
integrated with the other operational units, thus creating hours of work for the clinical staff, most of
whom gave up trying to secure organ donations. Interestingly, the Medical Examiner’s problem of a
declining autopsy rate was also a result of this same disjointed method of paperwork processing.

experience, and while they were supportive of
the team’s goals, they could not contribute in
a significant way to the team’s work. Senior
management provided inadequate support to
the team, neglecting to extend the authority
of organization leaders to the team and its
chair. This led some key team members to
dismiss the team as inconsequential and to an
overall lack of commitment.
The events at SUH illustrate multiple violations of building a successful, high-performing
team. The situation was improved, however, as
senior management became more involved,
setting an appropriate timeline, changing
membership, and conveying the importance of
the team to the organization. As team composition and size were restructured to include the
appropriate participants, senior management
also granted the team visible and legitimate
authority to undertake its tasks, and an environment of psychological safety was created
where open communication was encouraged
and individual team members could contribute with no risk of rebuke by others.
Teams are pervasive in health care and
used for virtually every activity carried out in
health care organizations, including clinical
and management-focused activities. While
our knowledge of evidence-based practices
continues to grow, implementation of these
practices has been uneven and fragmented.
The recent development of the field of implementation science, introduced in Chapter 3, has sought to address the challenges
of putting evidence into practice (Nilsen,
2015). While there is an array of obstacles

to implementation, the application of medical knowledge to clinical service delivery is
limited by the effectiveness and efficiency of
teams charged with putting that knowledge
into practice. Similarly, as new management
techniques and technologies are developed,
including QI methods, successful use of these
approaches is dependent upon appropriately
staffed, well-functioning teams. Clearly, we
have moved well beyond the era of the autonomous heroic clinician (or manager, for that
matter). It is not a stretch to state that behind
every successful clinician or manager is a
high-functioning team (or teams). And given
what we know about the effectiveness of teams
in most organizations, it can safely be said that
the performance of virtually all clinicians and
managers could be markedly improved by
improvements in team effectiveness.
Teams also play a critical role in improving the performance of health care systems,
whether a medical group practice, a hospital inpatient unit, a long-term care facility,
or local public health departments. While
effective patient care certainly requires that
physicians and others possess current clinical
knowledge, patient outcomes often depend
upon how well patient-care teams work—
whether team members understand and agree
on patient-care goals, how members communicate with each other, and the effectiveness
of team leadership. In sum, teams are the
building blocks of health care organizations
and are absolutely essential to implementing
plans, caring for populations and individual patients, and identifying and successfully

178

Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement

solving quality problems. Teams are not an
option but a necessity. As such, it makes great
sense to examine these building blocks and
see how they can be strengthened.
In this chapter, the concept of team is
applied very broadly, and shares characteristics with the concept of microsystems (Nelson
et al., 2002), which are also discussed in greater
detail, with specific application to patient
safety, in Chapter 9. A microsystem is one of
several subsystems of a larger system that is
integral to system performance. This perspective, drawn from systems theory, is not a new
concept but clearly helps us understand how
the human body, an automobile, or an organization, operates. When examining the performance of any system, it is essential to examine
(among other factors) the effectiveness of each
component subsystem (e.g., the respiratory
system), how these subsystems work together
(e.g., the nature and adequacy of coordination
between a hospital pharmacy and an inpatient
unit), and the adequacy of information about
system and subsystem performance (e.g., the
extent to which the driver of an automobile is
provided with information about the automobile’s performance).
According to this view, a health system
is composed of many subsystems. In patient
care, these may be referred to as clinical
microsystems or frontline systems, referring
to teams charged with meeting the needs
of the patient population. It is these smaller
microsystems that actually provide those services that result in positive patient outcomes,
provider and patient safety, system efficiency,
and patient satisfaction. And as is true with
any large system, the effectiveness of any large
health care system can be no better than the
microsystems of which it is composed (Nelson
et al., 2002).
Using the terminology of the microsystem,
it is apparent how a microsystem is in fact one
type of team, as defined by Nelson et al. (2002):
A clinical microsystem is a small
group of people who work together

on a regular basis to provide care to
discrete subpopulations of patients.
It has clinical and business aims,
linked processes, and a shared information environment, and it produces
performance outcomes. Microsystems
evolve over time and are often embedded in larger organizations. They
are complex adaptive systems, and as
such they must do the primary work
associated with core aims, meet the
needs of internal staff, and maintain
themselves over time as clinical units.
(p. 474)
This definition may be slightly altered
to apply to all other types of teams in health
care. The key concepts in relation to teams are
as follows:
■
■
■
■

People work together toward specific goals.
They use multiple interconnected processes.
They produce performance outcomes.
They have access to information about the
team’s performance.

In addition, teams must adapt to changing
circumstances, ensure the satisfaction of team
members, and maintain and improve their
performance over time.
In this chapter, we bring together several
traditions of research on teams. We demonstrate how our knowledge of teams informs
our understanding of team performance and
the important role of teams in QI efforts.
Most of the research on team effectiveness
has been carried out in relatively permanent
teams with stable membership and opportunities for face-to-face interactions. However,
many teams in health care and other sectors
exist for only a short period of time, perhaps as
short as a nursing shift. Because QI teams typically draw from multiple parts of an organization, these teams may exist for a limited period
of time. These types of teams must organize
themselves rapidly, and may not have the luxury of going through extended stages of team
development. In this chapter, attention is given

Teams in Health Care

to traditional as well as temporary teams. Simply put, today’s teams do not always fit into
traditional team structures and processes, and
we need to account for these variations when
discussing health care teams.

Teams in Health Care

As medical knowledge grows increasingly
complex and medical specialties continue to
develop around specific focus areas of that
knowledge, there is a risk that health care
organizations will lose their patient-centered
orientation. There is a paradox in relation to
the adoption of new medical technologies and
procedures. On the one hand, increasingly
specific diagnostic and treatment procedures
imply a narrowing of focus. This is desirable
because we all support the discovery and
implementation of procedures to improve
the sensitivity and specificity of diagnoses
and the development of pharmaceuticals,
technology, and procedures that treat a disease in a manner that is most specific to the
individual and the disease state. However,
to diagnose, treat, and provide continuing
care to a patient requires information from
multiple sources and, very often, the involvement of multiple individuals. For example,
psychopharmacology has become increasingly specific and sophisticated. However,
better utilization of new pharmaceuticals for
the benefit of the patient requires that psychiatrists have an understanding of a patient’s
social environment, which may require the
knowledge base of social workers and others. That is, a team of individuals (e.g., social
worker, psychiatric nurse) is likely required
to ensure that patients are compliant and
that home support and respite services
are available to caregivers. Thus, the need
for patient-centered multispecialty teams
becomes ever more important as health care
providers and organizations specialize and
strive to deliver the best and most appropriate care possible.

179

Health care system complexity extends
beyond the clinical care arena and into
administrative areas. Teams fill an organizational need of helping to identify and respond
to changes brought about by legal and regulatory changes, more complex payer contracts,
and increasing accountability and pressure
for value.
At the most basic level, clinical health
care teams are comprised of health care providers including nonclinical personnel from
multiple disciplines, focusing on a patient or
patient population with similar health care
needs. This patient-centeredness has extended
upward and outward to all aspects of many
health care organizations. Indeed, the industry has seen a trend away from organizational
structures based on functional areas of technical expertise (e.g., nursing, environmental
services, registration, medicine, surgery) and
toward functionally integrated organizational
structures with clinical care teams based on
patient needs (e.g., children’s services, women’s services, cancer care services). Individual clinical specialists serving on these teams
report not only to their disciplinary head (e.g.,
chief of nursing, chair of medicine), but also to
team leaders associated with specific patientcentered service areas. This “dual reporting”
format is described in organizational management literature as a matrix structure (Grove,
1995; Burns, Bradley, & Weiner, 2011). As
discussed later in this chapter, dual reporting
requirements pose challenges for managing
multidisciplinary teams.
While the multidisciplinary team model
has been adopted to improve patient-centered
health, these teams and supporting organizational structures do not spontaneously form,
nor are they easily managed. In fact, reward systems often work against the formation and effectiveness of teams. Reward systems are typically
designed around performance of one’s particular
discipline or function, rather than on an individual’s role on teams. Where teams do exist, performance is, more often than not, suboptimal. A
substantial body of research demonstrates that

180

Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement

key elements are necessary for teams to perform
to their maximum potential (Hackman, 2002).
If these elements are not attended to, dysfunctional teams can result in team member and
patient dissatisfaction, disjointed care provision,
and inefficient and ineffective operations nested
in a cumbersome bureaucracy.

High-Performance
Teams and Quality
Improvement

2.

The focus of this chapter is on the critical role
of high-performing teams in QI efforts, and on
strategies to improve team effectiveness. The
value of teams was established in the earliest
applications of QI as a way to ensure the multidisciplinary sharing of knowledge (Deming,
1986). In modern health care, teams are critical to success in QI for a number of reasons.
1.

Quality problems are often not visible to managers at middle or senior
management levels, but the impact
of problems can be experienced by
the entire organization, as shown
in the organ donation case (Case
Study 6-1). Hospital staff nurses,
for example, may see repeated
examples of poor communications between shifts that result in
a myriad of problems for patients
and families, physicians, and other
hospital staff. Each occurrence of
a problem may be dealt with and
resolved in a satisfactory manner;
however, in aggregate, these communication problems may become
costly in terms of wasted time,
reduced quality and patient safety,
and lack of continuity of care. Individuals on the front lines are quite
frequently aware of systemic problems requiring methodical analysis.

3.

One can easily make the case that
the farther one is from the front
lines of care, the more removed one
is from seeing and solving day-today problems. Thus, if we wish to
identify quality problems and optimal solutions, we need individuals
on our teams who are close to the
problem and can help uncover root
causes.
Health care organizations accomplish their work through a myriad
of processes, which may be flawed,
confusing, or inefficient. In some
instances, a process itself may be
ineffective, while in other cases,
a well-designed process may be
poorly implemented. That is, what
appears theoretically on paper
as an effective process flowchart
may be entirely inaccurate when
compared to how the process actually operates. Regardless, much of
QI involves process analysis and
improvement. Individuals working in dysfunctional processes are
often most knowledgeable about
process impacts and causes. Therefore, to understand a process, it is
essential to have participation from
individuals who have the most
accurate and detailed understanding of the process.
Individuals at the front lines often
have unique knowledge and insight
into organizational problems and
are thus in a position to offer effective and feasible suggestions for
improvement. It has long been
known that individuals at relatively
low levels of the organization often
acquire considerable knowledge
about the organization and are positioned to reduce uncertainty in the
organization, and, in some cases,
may use this knowledge to acquire

High-Performance Teams and Quality Improvement

power (Crozier, 1964). For example, a receptionist who has worked
in a pediatric group practice over
several years may have a very clear
understanding of why waiting
times are unacceptably long at certain times of the day. As a result of
that experience, he or she may have
a well-reasoned understanding of
how the practice operates and may
have valuable suggestions about
how scheduling and staffing may
be altered to help ameliorate the
waiting time problem. Note as well
that because the receptionist is a
“nonprofessional,” this person may
never have been asked to provide
input. If we are interested in solving such a problem, it is important
to have individuals on a team who
understand the problem and can
suggest changes that are both effective and feasible.
Addressing quality problems
requires the support of all affected
individuals, not simply those at
middle or senior management
levels. Identifying and proposing
solutions to quality problems is
central to QI efforts, but unless
those involved in solution implementation understand fully the
rationale for the effort, implementation is likely to fall short. Those
involved in implementing the
solution must be involved so that
they understand the QI strategy
and can identify possible obstacles
to effective implementation.
High-functioning teams empower
people by providing opportunities
for meaningful participation in
problem identification and problem
solving. Participants feel they are
contributing in a positive way to the
larger success of the organization,

181

and not simply through their particular discipline. Among the consequences of empowerment is that
people feel greater commitment to
the organization and have a stronger sense of ownership. Empowerment also has a direct impact on
increasing team members’ motivation, a critical element in successful QI initiatives (Daft, 2015).
Together, these consequences promote in people a greater willingness
to participate in developing and
implementing solutions.
As seen in the introductory organ donation example, the well-intentioned manager
tasked with solving an institution-wide problem was unable to constitute a team with
appropriate members. As a result, the team was
frustrated in its inability to achieve its goals.
However, one cannot place the blame entirely
on the manager. An unrealistic timeline and
the absence of initial support by senior management both played a role in the team’s failure. Given a second chance, and provided with
a more appropriate timeline and sufficient
authority, the manager built a team comprised
of individuals with appropriate experience and
organizational diversity; this team was able to
develop, perform, and reach its goals. Such
well-designed and managed teams can maximize communication, collaboration, patient
and staff satisfaction, and effective and efficient clinical care provision in an organization
that is continually able to adapt and improve in
the changing environment.
How do we develop and sustain highperforming QI teams? There is much that we
know about successful teams, and while there
is no guarantee that using all of the concepts
and recommendations in this chapter will
bring success, the chapter provides a framework to increase the likelihood of team success
and avoid many of the pitfalls faced by teams.
Understanding key aspects of team dynamics
can help to guide improvement efforts.

Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement

Understanding
and Improving the
Performance of
Quality Improvement
Teams

In this section, we present evidence about
teams and team management, relate this information to QI teams, and apply case examples
to illustrate selective concepts and principles.

Team Tasks and Goals
As a point of departure, all teams have goals
and specific tasks. Understanding the fundamental purposes of a team guides other aspects
of team development and management,
including team composition, decision-making
processes, and the types of interdependencies the team has with other entities in the
organization. In general, we can state that
QI teams are, by definition, focused on identifying and analyzing quality and patient safety
problems, designing interventions to address
these problems, and evaluating the impact of
changes. In one form or another, teams complete tasks aligned with the Planning, Doing,
Checking, Acting (PDCA) cycle, which was
first introduced in Chapter 1 and is discussed with various applications throughout
this text. The clarity of the task as well as the
authority/empowerment of the team to carry
out improvement efforts is very important in
engaging team members. Essentially, team
members should have a shared understanding
of the goals of the team.
Although some teams have clear and
self-evident goals, QI teams may face ambiguity. The nature of QI itself is a process of
discovery; as root causes of problems are
uncovered, teams may find that the task of the
team changes. For example, a team working
in a clinic in a low-income country may be

investigating the problem of drug stock-outs.
The team may find that a key root cause of
the problem is an inconsistent supply chain,
and supply chain problems in turn are due to
poor communication between clinic staff and
a central supply depot. Further, communication problems may be due to frequent gaps in
electricity in the clinic as well as in the supply
depot. An intervention to reduce stock-outs
may therefore require team members with
expertise in addressing problems of power
outages and connectivity. In this case, the initial composition of the team may be inadequate to address the root cause of the problem.
The team may wish to add a team member
from the supply depot to help suggest changes
in how and when the clinic communicates
with the supply depot. The point here is that as
fundamental underlying problems are identified, a team’s tasks may change. In the preceding example, a new task emerged: addressing
power outages.
A common problem in teams is related
to a lack of clarity about the team’s authority to implement change. The question arises
as to whether a team has the authority to make
decisions and implement changes, or simply
to make recommendations. There is no single
answer to this question; many highly variable
factors ranging from organizational politics to
intra-organizational dynamics to environmental changes may influence a team’s authority.
What is most important is that teams have
a clear understanding of the limits of their
authority. It is disheartening and demotivating
for team members to believe the team has the
authority to implement a change only to face
the reality that the team is limited to providing
suggestions or recommendations.
As illustrated in the Greenwood Family
Medicine example (CASE STUDY 6.2), goal definition presents a problem. The initial goal in
the case study’s situation was to improve the
provision of preventive services. However, little
analytic effort was spent trying to understand
the important causes of the problem. The team
adopted a premature solution, and the goal

CASE STUDY 6.2: PREVENTIVE SERVICES
AT GREENWOOD FAMILY MEDICINE
Greenwood Family Medicine is a five-clinician family medicine practice serving a largely middleclass suburban population. In addition to the medical staff, the practice employs four nurses, one
receptionist, and three medical records and insurance technicians.
The practice recently identified two priority areas: attention to family concerns and greater
emphasis on ensuring the provision of timely preventive services. The latter effort was prompted
by one of the physicians, who had recently attended a continuing medical education program
on preventive services. Upon her return, she decided to assess the practice’s provision of
preventive services.
With a nurse and one of the medical records technicians, she reviewed a sample of children’s
patient charts. She and the other physicians were surprised when she distributed the results:
■
■
■
■
■
■

Half of the children were behind schedule in at least one immunization.
No patient charts noted that children had had vision screening.
Fifty percent of children had not had anemia screening.
Seventy-five percent of children had not had their blood pressure recorded in the chart.
Eighty-five percent had not had tuberculosis screening.
Eighty-seven percent of children had not been screened for lead exposure.

The medical staff was surprised by these findings, but medical records personnel and nursing
staff found this information consistent with their impressions. The review indicated that even children
who were seen for an annual physical were often not updated on preventive services—or if they were,
this information was not recorded in the patient chart. It was felt that high patient volume made it
impossible to ensure that appropriate preventive services were provided to all children. In addition, the
practice saw many drop-in patients. The nurses felt that while these drop-ins caused added tension
from the increased workload, they also presented an opportunity to check on patients’ needs for
preventive services.
The findings were discussed at the monthly meeting for all staff, and it was decided to form a
team to address the problem. A medical records technician was asked to schedule a meeting. It was
decided that two nurses and four physicians would participate on this team.
The first meeting was scheduled over the noon hour (12:00 PM to 1:00 PM). One physician arrived
at 12:20, while another had to leave early, at 12:45. Virtually the entire meeting was spent attempting to
find an appropriate date and time for follow-up meetings.
At the next meeting, the physicians stated that during an acute visit, physicians simply do not
have time to go through the chart to determine if a patient needs updating on preventive services. It
was decided, therefore, that the nurses would review each chart for the day’s patients and fasten a form
listing all preventive services. Services needing updating would be circled. The medical records staff
was asked to design this form.
When the physicians saw the resulting form, they felt it was poorly designed. Some services were not
included, and immunization schedule information was not included. The physicians asked the medical
records technician to redesign the form. The technician and a nurse added the immunization schedule
and other information. When presented to the physicians, they discovered disagreements in several areas.
Immunization schedules differed, and practices varied on lead and TB screening. They decided that the
form should include separate columns for each physician, each column specifying a physician’s preventive
services preferences. A form was created reflecting each physician’s preventive service preferences.

CASE STUDY 6.2: PREVENTIVE SERVICES
AT GREENWOOD FAMILY MEDICINE

(continued)

After the new preventive services chart was developed, the nurses expressed concern about the
lack of time available to record preventive services needs but agreed reluctantly to start reviewing
charts and entering preventive service information on each chart. After 6 weeks of working with this
system, the following events unfolded:
■
■
■

■

■

Nurses complained that medical records staff were not making charts available in time to do the
preventive services review.
Physicians complained among themselves that preventive service information was incomplete
or inaccurate in more than 50% of the cases.
Nurses were spending an additional 1 to 2 hours in the office preparing the next day’s files and
complained that the charts were very hard to decipher. The nurses requested, and were denied,
overtime pay. One nurse left the practice.
Confusion was rampant when charts were prepared for one physician but another physician
actually saw the patient. This caused increased patient waiting time. An even more difficult
problem was caused by drop-ins for whom the record review was not prepared. Nurses spent up
to 30 minutes reviewing drop-in charts and recording relevant information. Backlogs resulted,
and nurses neglected their other roles.
The system was eliminated, and physicians decided to independently deal with preventive services.

drifted away from improving preventive service rates to constructing and implementing a
preventive services chart. While such a chart
may have been useful as part of the solution to
the performance gap in preventive services, the
team became fixated on this as the solution, at
the expense of generating other more impactful alternatives. Implementing a solution
became the goal, and the team lost its initial
focus on the problem of low preventive services rates. Team member time was spent constructing a tool instead of trying to understand
the fundamental causes of the problem. Basically, a “solution” presented itself, and the solution became the goal in itself. A key problem
faced as a result of this is that the team did not
work on what seemed to be a very major problem facing the practice, namely, the variation
in protocols for preventive services. The team
also did not sufficiently examine the problem
of record keeping and never came to an understanding of whether their rates were really low

or whether the problem was an artifact of poor
record keeping. The use of a cause-and-effect
diagram, first introduced and explained in
Chapter 4, may have helped, and most important, effective leadership may have kept the
team on task and focused on its primary goal.

Team Characteristics
Team characteristics refer to basic physical
and social psychological aspects of a team
and include team composition and size, relationships between team members, status differences, level of psychological safety, team
norms, and the team’s stage of team development. All of these characteristics potentially
affect the team effectiveness.

Team Composition and Size
What is the optimal composition and size of
a team? This answer obviously depends upon
the nature of the team, its goals, and tasks. In

Understanding and Improving the Performance of Quality Improvement Teams

some cases, team size and composition are
mandated, such as sports teams and accreditation teams. Teams must be sufficiently
large to have the requisite expertise to get
the work done, but not so large that they are
cumbersome and difficult to manage. In the
Greenwood Family Medicine example (Case
Study 6-2), the team faced multiple problems
because of its unwieldy size and difficulty
scheduling meetings, keeping order during
meetings, establishing a protocol for discussion, and decision making.
Interestingly, although the team was too
large, it did not in fact contain all of the expertise required to address the preventive services
problem. The Institute for Health Improvement suggest that successful QI teams require
four general types of expertise. A clinical leader
is an individual who has authority in the organization to test and implement changes and
to overcome implementation problems. A
team member with technical expertise has a
thorough understanding of the systems and
processes of care. A third key area of expertise is a team member who is a subject matter
expert and is in a position to drive the project on a day-to-day basis—a project manager
of sorts. Finally, teams need a project sponsor
who has the executive authority to serve as a
link with senior management; this individual
may or may not be a member of the team on
a day-to-day basis (IHI, 2017), but is essential
for success.
In the Greenwood Family Medicine
example, the medical records staff, who foresaw the difficulties with the new system, were
not included on the team—even to selectively
provide input or react to proposed solutions.
When deciding upon team composition, one
needs to consider the tasks facing the team.
For example, if information is required about
information technology, it would naturally be
helpful to have someone knowledgeable in this
area. In the Greenwood Family Medicine case,
abstracting information from medical records
was a key aspect of the intervention. Medical
records staff familiar with the structure of the

185

medical record could have contributed substantially to the design of this intervention.
Team size therefore goes hand-in-hand
with team composition. The team must have
adequate diversity and expertise to inform all
aspects of the team’s tasks and goals. Yet the
team must not be so large that reaching consensus or following an appropriate timeline is
impossible. In Greenwood Family Medicine, it
would have been advisable to cut the team size
by 50% and ask team members to consult and
obtain input from their constituencies about
the team’s work.
In today’s work world, team size and
composition may vary significantly over short
periods of time. An individual may join a
team for a short period of time to address a
specific technical problem. In addition, it is
common for members in team meetings to
rotate attendance. For example, if the nursing
perspective is required to address a problem, it
would not be uncommon for different nurses
to attend team meetings over time. This type
of arrangement is often necessary because of
the realities of organizational life; people have
multiple commitments and time pressures
that may require flexibility in team membership. Furthermore, teams also vary in terms
of their permanence and longevity. We traditionally think of teams as relatively permanent
and stable groups of people. However, there
are instances where a team must quickly form
and work together over a short period of time.
In health care organizations, teams may form
and disband over a period of a shift. Edmondson (2012) coined the term “teaming” to refer
to an organization capable of collaborating
and coordinating without the necessary team
structures, such as stable team membership.
She refers to this capability as “team on the
fly.” As described by Edmondson, individuals
working in hospital emergency departments
must work as a team, although each shift may
bring different team members who may not
have previously worked together. Valentine
and Edmondson (2015) used the term “scaffolding” to describe a number of ways in which

186

Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement

organizations can support the development
and effective operation of temporary teams on
a continuous basis.

Team Relationships and Status
Because we often learn about quality problems
from individuals situated at different levels and
units of an organization, a central tenet of QI
is participation of a broad array of team members. These include individuals at relatively
low levels in the organization without formal
authority but with considerable tacit knowledge. In fact, it is often those on the front lines
who bring unique perspectives and insights
into a situation.
Involving an appropriate range of people
is only the first step, however. In any team, people bring with them their roles and status from
regular organizational life. Physicians working
on a team with nurses bring with them their
higher professional status and authority. The
physician–nurse relationship, however that
is characterized in a particular organization,
is thus “imported” into the team. These preformed relationships and status systems may
influence the participation of team members
and affect the effectiveness of a team. Individuals from a lower status group are less likely
to contribute than those of higher status. They
may feel condescended to or intimidated, or
they may simply feel that their input is not
valued. For QI teams, such status differences
are dysfunctional. To engage all team members and ensure that the team can utilize each
member’s knowledge, QI team leaders need
to find a way to diminish the impact of status
differences.
The important role of nurses as equals on
QI teams should not be underestimated. For
example, this recognition has contributed to
the important leadership role of nurses in the
development and implementation of a number
of quality initiatives, such as surgical safety
checklists (Gawande, 2009).
Team members bring to the team previously formed relationships. We may find two

individuals with a history of interpersonal
problems serving on the same team. Unfortunately, relationship problems and dysfunctional status differences can dramatically affect
the work of a team. It is truly the remarkable
team that can dispose of status differences
and interpersonal animosities in the interest
of team goals. At the very least, team leaders
need to be aware of status differences and the
impact of those differences on communication
and team effectiveness. One way to avoid the
problems of status difference and interpersonal conflict is to have a team leader with sufficient authority and respect act as moderator,
encouraging lower status members to participate, keeping higher status members in check,
and defusing tension driven by team member
conflict. A key characteristic of effective team
leaders that is often absent in science and
health care activities is the ability to resolve
conflicts (Sapienza, 2004); this is a characteristic which can increase motivation and help to
ensure a team’s success.
People who work on QI teams typically
have “regular” jobs in the organization, and
their participation in improvement efforts
requires time away from their normal work. It
is therefore important to reduce the amount
of time lost to process issues, or issues that
are not part of the actual task of the team.
These include dealing with logistical issues
such as scheduling meetings, as well as managing conflict. Teams may come together
amidst great enthusiasm about tackling a difficult problem. However, the work of a group
may create frictions and bring to the surface
latent conflicts or reignite old disputes. Interprofessional rivalries, which may have been
part of the organizational culture for many
years, may surface, and leaders should devise
strategies to manage and minimize these
conflicts. Otherwise, a substantial amount
of work time may be lost managing these
conflicts. QI teams, like other teams, are also
prone to personality clashes that may be very
destructive to the work of a team. Health care
is particularly prone to difficulties posed by

Understanding and Improving the Performance of Quality Improvement Teams

status differences because of the traditional
professional hierarchy common in most
organizations.
In Greenwood Family Medicine, status
differences were destructive to the work of
the group. First, medical records staff were
not included, likely because they were considered nonprofessional staff and their perspectives and opinions were discounted.
Status differences, with likely elements of
intimidation, also prevented both nurses and
medical records staff from voicing their reservations about the use of the preventive services chart. There was also tension and status
differences between the two “high-volume”
physicians and others in the practice. These
differences were not beneficial to the work of
the team.

Psychological Safety
Team psychological safety is defined as a
shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking (Edmondson, 1999). A
central tenet of QI is the belief that people
must be forthcoming and honest about quality problems, even where they themselves were
responsible for, or shared responsibility for, a
quality or patient safety incident. Individuals
involved in improvement efforts must feel that
their suggestions will be heard without fear of
intimidation, condescension, or castigation
(Deming, 1986). Where people feel safe, there
is a greater likelihood of their participating
effectively in QI efforts. Furthermore, psychological safety is an important prerequisite for
implementing organizational change. People
need to feel psychologically safe if they are to
feel secure and capable of changing (Schein &
Bennis, 1965).
Status differences certainly affect psychological safety. Where status differences have
an oppressive presence, it is very unlikely that
team participants will feel the willingness to
participate in discussions of quality. In the
Greenwood Family Medicine case, the medical records staff had a clear sense that the

187

preventive services chart plan was doomed
to failure, but felt uninvited. Although they
voiced reservations about the plan privately,
they did not feel comfortable voicing their
concerns. They had a fear, likely justifiable,
that they would have been criticized by others
in the practice for being negative, resistant to
change, or perhaps lazy. This is similar to the
Donor Services case (Case Study 6-1), where
many of the lower-status team members were
reluctant to participate actively or positively
given the negative and highly vocal nature of
the Medical Examiner, a higher-status individual with whom many of the team members
had to work on a daily basis. They felt that if
they didn’t follow his lead in the team meetings, they would incur repercussions later.
Team leaders need to consider questions
of psychological safety: Do participants feel
safe in making recommendations, participating in discussions, and perhaps of greatest
importance, expressing skepticism and disagreement? Leaders must examine their own
behavior and assess the extent to which their
leadership style and manner of interaction
invites participation and promotes safety. It
is only by creating such a climate that team
members will not become “yes-men” and “yeswomen,” also described by Grove (1995) as
“peer group syndrome,” a situation that results
when group members fear stating an opinion
that goes against the group.

Team Norms
A norm is a standard of behavior that is shared
by team members. Norms set expectations
and establish standards of behavior and performance. Norms have a strong impact on
individuals in organizations, essentially establishing the “rules” under which people function. Behavioral norms consist of rules that
govern individual behavior and attitudes. In
a team context, behavioral norms define how
people are expected to behave on a team.
These may include expectations about attendance, preparation for team meetings, and the

188

Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement

manner in which members communicate with
each other during and between team meetings. Norms are different in every team. In
the Greenwood Family Medicine case study,
we see the interaction between status differences and norms. Although there was likely a
superficial belief in the desirability of a democratic and participative climate, it was clear
that behavioral norms emphasized a high
regard for hierarchy. For example, nurses were
directed to produce a form (and then several
versions), and physicians declared the termination of the QI initiative. Norms about attendance at meetings were very loose—at least for
the medical staff. One meeting, in which arguments ensued about whether the preventive
services issue was office wide or specific to the
physicians, ended with no conclusion, summary, or future plans. Evidently, norms were
never established for how meetings would
be conducted or expectations for attendance.
Norms were nonexistent or dysfunctional.
Participation was inhibited, full discussion of
issues was repressed, and meetings were inefficient and ineffective.
In contrast to behavioral norms, performance norms govern the amount and quality
of work expected of team members. In the
Greenwood Family Medicine case, performance norms were broken, leading to difficulties for the practice. While there were
expectations about working hours for nurses,
the new preventive services chart system
required that they work up to 3 hours after
regular working hours—a break from normal
working hours. This change in work demand
was not anticipated, and breaking this performance norm caused morale problems and the
departure of at least one nurse.

Stages of Team Development
Teams go through various life cycle stages, and
different tasks and levels of productivity characterize each stage. We can conveniently think
of teams going through four stages: forming,
storming, norming, and performing. These

stages, first described by Tuckman (1965), are
best viewed as guides, and not rigid expectations. The speed with which teams proceed
through these stages varies greatly and some
teams never move to the final stage of performing. A team begins in the forming stage
when goals and tasks are established. It is characterized by generally polite behavior among
team members, which may mask underlying
conflicts. Individuals often do not feel psychologically safe at this time and may be reluctant
to contribute and unlikely to disagree. Team
members, still unclear about the norms of the
team, may stand back until they get a sense of
norms and “rules” of the team.
When team members begin to feel
more comfortable, there may be a period of
“storming,” which may be mild or severe.
Team members may compete for roles, may
argue about team goals and processes, or may
simply attempt to stake their ground. This type
of conflict is normal, and if managed well by
the team leader, can result in a resolution of
important issues.
If the team resolves its storming stage
(which does not always happen), a norming
stage emerges in which there is agreement on
team norms and expectations. Team member
roles are clarified, although these may change
during the life of a team.
Following the norming stage is a performing stage in which the team is in the best
position to accomplish its goals. Conflicts have
mainly been resolved, roles are clear, norms
are established, and team time can be spent on
the substantive work of the team rather than
on process issues.
Teams can function at all stages of their
development. However, at earlier stages, much
energy is lost to “process loss”—that is, focusing the team’s energies and time on team
maintenance functions rather than on the
substantive work of the team. Teams are most
effective when they have matured, meaning
they have successfully progressed through the
first three stages and are able to focus on team
goals and tasks.

Resources and Support

What stage of development did the Greenwood Family Medicine team reach? The team
that was assembled for the preventive services
improvement project included virtually all
members of the practice. This team did not
show evidence of maturity. Norms of behavior were unclear (for example, attendance at
meetings), decision making and rules for discussion were not well developed, and perhaps
most importantly, role relationships among
participants still reflected their roles in the
practice. Physicians assumed a rather superior role in the practice, which may or may not
have been appropriate. On the improvement
team, however, such a role was clearly inappropriate and blocked the team from accessing
information needed to address the preventive
services problem. It is likely that the events
that transpired in this case could have been
predicted from observing the team’s inability
to move through stages of development.

Resources and Support

As open systems, teams require resources in
order to survive and flourish. Resources come
in a number of forms, including financial
resources; intellectual resources; information;
people with the necessary knowledge, skills, and
abilities; equipment; communication systems;
and moral support and credibility. Furthermore,
individual team members require support,
including recognition for their work on the team
and rewards for their performance. At the most
fundamental level, a team functions best when
ensconced within an organization that supports
the concept of teamwork and, more specifically,
respects the work done by the team. We begin
our discussion of resources and support at this
level, with a brief review of the definition and
concepts related to organizational culture.

Organizational Culture
Many definitions have been suggested for
organizational culture. Broadly speaking,

189

organizational culture refers to the fabric of
values, beliefs, assumptions, myths, norms,
goals, and visions that are widely shared in
the organization (French, 1998). An organization can have a single culture, although there
are often subcultures within the organization.
Among health care organizations, for example, we would expect to see cultural differences between a large teaching hospital and a
small, rural medical practice. Within an organization, teams themselves can develop their
own culture; as with ethnic cultures, these
organizational cultures may include rituals, a
specific language, particular modes of communication, and unique systems of rewards
and sanctions.
Organizational culture has a number of
implications for teams. First, effective teams
are usually characterized by a culture that is
respectful and supportive of team members,
with appropriate levels of empowerment. In a
QI team, for example, we would hope to see
a culture characterized by interdisciplinary
respect, open communication, and a collective
spirit. It would be very difficult to imagine a
successful QI team that does not share these
and other cultural characteristics.
Consider an organization characterized
by intense and dysfunctional competition,
low staff participation in decision making,
and interprofessional rivalries and antagonism. We can consider this type of organization as having a dissonant culture (Fleeger,
1993). Notwithstanding the skills of an effective team leader, can we really expect team
members drawn from such an environment
to perform effectively on a multidisciplinary
team? It’s more likely that team member
attitudes would mirror their attitudes and
behaviors outside the team. Team members
would probably exhibit distrust, a “them vs.
us” norm, and skepticism about their role in
decision making.
Consider the behavior and attitudes of
team members drawn from a positive or consonant culture. We would expect team members to bring with them the very supportive

190

Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement

cultural attributes of the larger organization; this would contribute to team growth
and performance. We can see how the larger
organizational culture can be viewed as a
resource: The larger culture can be highly
supportive, unsupportive, or destructive to
the work of the team.
Although challenging, a team can develop
a strong and appropriate culture while
enmeshed in an organization with a contrary
culture. This is not ideal and requires leadership that can help to build a team culture
that does in fact serve the interests of team
effectiveness.

Changing Culture
Cultures are very difficult to change, so team
leaders and participants must understand the
impact of the culture of the larger organization on the work and culture of the team.
Team members’ negative or dysfunctional attitudes may simply reflect how they are treated
in the larger organization. Team leaders
should acknowledge the difficulty of leading a

participative improvement team within a larger
organizational culture that is nonparticipative
and autocratic. Staff who work in a rigid, overbearing culture are likely to become skeptical
when suddenly asked to participate in decision
making, wondering whether their opinions
will be valued, and so forth. QI efforts in health
care often confront this contradictory culture
issue, experiencing the difficulties of attempting to introduce a culture that is inconsistent
with the dominant organizational culture.
In the state regulatory agency case
(CASE STUDY 6.3), there was a culture that
stressed the importance of customer relations. Value was placed on the need to provide
accurate and timely information. The team
that was formed to analyze and make recommendations about the problem of providing
inaccurate information was motivated by the
same belief in the importance of its service
mission. Multiple teams were formed, each
adopting this organizational culture, leading
to improved communication and overall influence on policy; and ultimately more accurate
information to customers.

CASE STUDY 6.3: ERRONEOUS INFORMATION
AT A STATE REGULATORY AGENCY
The Department of Health and Emergency Services is a state regulatory agency dealing with a
variety of health care professional issues. Its roles include credentialing emergency medical service
(EMS) personnel, providers, and educational institutions; developing and enforcing administrative
code; and serving as a primary collection point for statewide EMS data. Among its most important
roles is responding to requests for information about credentialing requirements for health and
EMS personnel. These requests come from physicians, hospitals, EMS providers, city and county
governments, and other organizations.
The agency has one main office and three regional offices. The main office has 30 staff members;
each regional office is staffed by 5 to 7 people. Each regional office has a regional manager reporting
to the Operations Section Chief. Since each regional office serves approximately one-third of the state,
the volume of requests can be overwhelming. Each staff member is responsible for serving as primary
contact for 8 to 14 counties.
The agency recently learned that a significant amount of inaccurate information has been
distributed by regional staff. The agency learned about this problem from complaints that inaccurate
and contradictory information had been given out. For example, a hospital requested information

Resources and Support

191

about how nurses could challenge the EMS exam. The hospital was informed that nurses could
challenge the EMS exam when in fact agency policy prohibits any health care provider from
challenging a credentialing exam.
In response to this problem, the agency director formed an education/credentialing team with
one liaison in each regional office and the team leader in the main office. The team’s goals included
improving consistency among the three regional offices, ensuring accurate information distribution,
and educating regional staff on agency policy. In addition to the team leader and regional office
liaisons, the team also included members representing each specialty within the agency. These
specialists would provide technical information about their particular specialty and serve as the
primary contact for regional offices in their area of expertise.
The team met monthly for 12 months to discuss issues and develop policy. One of its first tasks
was to determine the underlying reason(s) for its information dissemination problem. The team
obtained information from its membership and through discussions with other staff in the state and
regional offices, EMS providers, physicians, and educational institutions. Information was obtained
through formal and informal discussions, surveys, and a Web-based forum.
Among the team’s discoveries was that staff did not have clear channels of communication with
senior management and were not informed about changes in regulatory requirements. The team also
learned that regional office staff were trying to be “experts” in too many different fields.
The team suggested a number of changes, including the following:
■

■
■

Each regional staff member will be assigned an area of specialization; thus, each member will
serve the entire region instead of 8 to 14 counties. For example, one provider specialist would be
the primary point of contact for all provider issues for the entire regional office.
Each of these specialists will serve as the regional office representative on all statewide and intraagency committees that focus on that area of specialization.
Each regional manager will serve on a committee with senior management that will meet
monthly to ensure that up-to-date information is distributed to each regional office.

These changes were implemented at the state and regional offices. Mandatory committee
attendance was difficult because of statewide travel restrictions and budget shortfalls. These obstacles
were overcome by using advanced computer technology and telecommunications. Other obstacles
included changes in job descriptions that were resisted by several “old timers.” Their fears were eased
by giving them an opportunity to assist with writing their job description.
Six months after these changes were put in place, the distribution of incorrect credentialing
information dramatically decreased. Specialists in the regional offices actively consulted other
specialists to learn about current policy in their area. An informal telephone survey found consistent
information dissemination from each regional office. Among the most successful strategies was
formation of teams. This promoted consistency in information exchange and developed interagency
communication between all regional offices and the main office. It was also felt that success was
attributed in large part to the manner in which team members were selected and how the teams
functioned.
The team concept has continued to grow within the agency, and currently every staff member
within the agency serves on at least one team. Some members serve on several teams and have taken
on additional work responsibilities because the team approach has provided them the opportunity to
have a strong voice within the agency. Senior leadership was careful not to push the team approach
too fast and did not force anyone to join a team right away. Since the education team was formed first,
management emphasized the work that team performed and allowed the education team to provide
monthly updates to staff. This helped show that voice is important within the agency and that if staff
members work together as a team, the team will have a significant influence on agency policy as well
as administrative code.

192

Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement

Material and Nonmaterial
Support and Recognition
Regardless of their function, effective teams
require material resources. As noted previously, material resources take a number of
forms and vary depending on the goals and
needs of the team. Provision of necessary
material and nonmaterial support to a team is
a reflection of the moral support and encouragement given a team by the larger organization and, in particular, senior management or
other authority. Consider a team that is given
appropriate space and time to meet, where
senior managers on occasion voluntarily drop
in on team meetings to provide information
and support, or simply to reinforce the importance of a team’s task, and where support staff
are assigned to the team to assist in its work.
Furthermore, while the team is given a specific mandate and set of goals, team members
collectively decide on the manner in which it
carries out most of its work. Finally, upon presenting a preliminary report, detailed feedback
and questions are provided the team by all
relevant stakeholders. In all likelihood, team
members will feel as if their work is valued
and that the team’s work is indeed making a
contribution to the larger organization. Consistent with the motivational and satisfying
qualities of jobs defined in the Job Characteristics Model, such a team provides members
with autonomy, feedback, a sense of meaningfulness, and a belief that their work is having
a broad impact (Hackman & Oldham, 1980).
In sum, giving teams appropriate support can
be highly motivating. Where this support is
absent or ambiguous, teams will be starved for
support and will be unlikely to produce at an
optimal level.
The state regulatory agency case (Case
Study 6-3) provides a good example of how
a team was provided with adequate support.
Perhaps the most important resource provided
was the time and energy of various individuals internal and external to the agency. Time
was provided for team meetings, and team

members felt that the work they were doing
was worthwhile and valued by others in the
larger organization. Where travel restrictions
posed obstacles to team members’ ability
to meet in person, computer technology—
telecommunications and teleconferencing—
was used. This again reinforced the importance
not only of the team’s work but also of each
team member’s contributions.

Rewards and Motivation
Related to support and recognition is the
need for team and individual rewards. From
the perspective of the team, rewards typically
come in the form of recognition and commendation for the team’s work. In QI, team rewards
usually consist of the intrinsic satisfaction of
overcoming some quality challenge, that is,
achieving results. Rewards may also consist
of the positive feelings created by a successful
team effort. Factors that contribute to team
members’ intrinsic motivation are of critical
importance in QI efforts (Deming, 1994).
In addition to team rewards, individuals
on teams need to be rewarded. Participation
on teams is sometimes ambiguously defined as
something between the person’s job and a voluntary effort, that is, it may not be perceived as
part of a staff member’s “real job.” Job descriptions themselves may indicate little about
team participation. Performance appraisals
may not include team participation criteria,
and compensation and promotion decisions
may not take into consideration a staff member’s contribution to the work of a team. A
team-oriented organization will be more likely
to recognize individual contributions on teams
by including teamwork in job descriptions,
performance appraisal systems, and incentive compensation programs. Team-oriented
organizations may also provide training in
teamwork. Rewards are therefore important
from the perspective of both the team and its
individual members. Like individuals, teams
are motivated by appropriate recognition and
rewards. Individuals working on teams should

Team Processes

receive the message that their participation
on teams is important, necessary, and a key
part of their jobs. As with team recognition
these concepts represent intrinsic individual
rewards that have a strong impact on motivating team members to achieve quality outcomes
(Deming, 1994). A key step in this process of
ensuring intrinsic motivation is empowerment
of team members in order to achieve their
highest levels of performance (Daft, 2015).
Members of the state regulatory agency
team from Case Study 6-3 were able to see the
consequences of their work, namely, a substantial decrease in the amount of erroneous
information provided and better relations
with their customers. Team members also saw
their recommendations put into action, which
communicated to team members the value of
the team’s work. This set the stage for a more
team-focused agency and the likelihood that
future team efforts would meet with success.

▸

Team Processes

Team processes refer to those aspects of the
team dealing with leadership, communication,
decision making, and member and team learning. Each of these factors can have an important impact on the effectiveness of a team.

Team Leadership
Ideally, the leader of a QI team should have
thorough knowledge of the organization and
the problem being addressed, as well as the
authority to implement changes and overcome barriers to implementation. The leader
should also have an appreciation of the implications of suggested changes on other units in
the organization, as well as authority over all
areas affected by proposed changes. Finally,
the leader should be authorized to allocate
space, time, and human resources to the team
(HRSA, n.d.). As noted, these are ideal conditions, but there are times when the team
leader is appointed or emerges from group

193

deliberations. Individuals assuming team
leader roles may lack some of these characteristics. Absent these qualities, successful
teams require support from key people outside of the team who are in actual positions
of authority. These are discussed later in the
chapter in a section devoted to external support. Discussion on leadership below applies
to team leaders who have the formal authority
as described above, as well as leaders who lack
many of these qualities.
Leadership has taken on many meanings through the last century, with early
writing on leadership emphasizing plans,
details, roles, budgets, processes, and schedules. These perspectives were based in an era
when technology was simple and predictable,
products and customers were uniform, and
scientific principles could be applied to work
to maximize productivity. The legacy of this
era is still with us, evidenced by management
attitudes toward workers and the use of fear
as a means of controlling workers. We are, of
course, in a very different era in which uncertainty and unpredictability are normal, and
where the ability of an organization or team
to be successful requires it to put itself in a
position to learn.
Where a team task is clear and unambiguous, a top-down leadership style may be justified, although even in such settings, input from
team members may be valuable. In essence, the
traditional role of a leader in low-uncertainty
settings is to see that the job is done and that
team members communicate and coordinate
their work. In the QI area, however, leadership
must take on a different look. Quality improvement is based on learning and discovery; while
the team leader should be very knowledgeable
about the issues under examination, no one
person has all of the information to solve or
even identify the sources of quality challenges.
QI is by definition ambiguous and is largely a
problem-solving process. Team members participate on a QI team because they have expertise relevant to the problem. Team members
do not need to be told what to do, but rather

194

Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement

encouraged to participate actively in identifying problems, analyzing causation, developing
interventions, evaluating the impact of change,
and so forth. Team members are brought onto
a QI team because no single person has the
expertise to solve a particular problem. Team
member passivity is most definitely not an
appropriate strategy.
In an era where uncertainty is the norm,
leadership styles are required that emphasize
eliciting information from others, sharing of
information, and using that information to
collaboratively design change initiatives. In
sum, the need for a participative style of leadership is unavoidable if we hope our teams be
effective. Learning how to use a participative
leadership style is not easy, and it is much easier to exercise an autocratic style, although it
is doubtful that this style will result in positive
outcomes. A participative leader does not simply listen to others but encourages and seeks
out information from team members and

individuals outside of the team (Daft, 2015).
A participative leader must recognize that
teams have both formal and informal leaders.
A sports team, for example, may have a coach
or manager, but there clearly can be informal
leaders, usually not specifically appointed as
such, but nevertheless assuming a leadership
function. A multidisciplinary health care team
may have a nominal team leader, but typically
power and authority flow to nonleaders who
have specialized knowledge or expertise; this is
the root of the concept of empowerment (Daft,
2015). A leader must be able to recognize informal leaders, ascertain how to best use their
expertise and authority, and empower team
members to apply their expertise and authority for the good of the team. Consider the case
of Jones Hospital (CASE STUDY 6.4), which has
many different, unique programs and program
leaders with specific clinical expertise. These
providers sometimes work independently,
but more often than not work in concert to

CASE STUDY 6.4: FORMATION OF A MEDICAL
CENTER SERVICE LINE TO ADDRESS NEEDS FOR
COMMUNICATION AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT
Jones Hospital is an academic medical center with 850 beds and an operating budget of more than
$1 billion. In 1998, the hospital decided to develop service lines in an effort to better coordinate
administrative, clinical, and business development needs of the institution. The objectives of
this initiative were to integrate hospital and physician practice operations and bring together
support services in an effort to develop more efficient and effective operational planning, market
development, and patient-care QI. To accomplish this, the hospital divided all functional areas into
13 service lines, one of which was the Oncology Clinical Service Unit (CSU). This CSU encompassed,
among others, inpatient medical oncology units, radiation oncology, and the adult bone marrow
transplant program.
A few of the organization’s goals were realized in the first 4 years after the creation of the
CSU structure: communication among functional areas was enhanced, identification of strategic
opportunities was improved, and day-to-day management was stronger. However, expectations were
not met regarding strategic plan development, collaborative business plan development, resource
allocation, and revenue management. It was noted that the challenges of meeting organizational
goals were in part due to the continuing decentralized management of several critical areas. Even
with the creation of the CSU, other oncology areas remained independent of the service line: The
Jones Oncology Network, the NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Tumor Registry,

Team Processes

195

the Cancer Protocol Coordination Team, the medical school clinical departments, and the faculty
practice plan’s outpatient clinics. These, along with various support functions such as Management
Engineering and Medical Center Finance, were critical to success with oncology strategy and
operations. Yet there was no structure that pulled the various constituencies together to work toward
improving cancer patient care.
To address this problem, the medical center conducted a review of all oncology service areas
and related support functions, including an assessment of specific challenges attributable to the
current infrastructure. The review and assessment revealed operational fragmentation due to a
lack of coordination and communication, independent priority-setting among areas, few changeimplementation efforts, and a misalignment of incentives regarding both compensation and patient
flow. Furthermore, the review pointed to the near impossibility of developing strategic and business
plans for growing patient populations since there was not an agreed-upon process for developing and
approving such plans among the many stakeholders.
In response, the CSU developed an internal program model to enhance efficiency and effectiveness
by taking a patient-centered, QI approach. Based on the major cancer patient populations, specific
programs were created inside the CSU, including the Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Program, the Breast
Oncology Program, the GI Oncology Program, and the GYN Oncology Program, among others. Each
program operated using a matrix model centered on the cancer patient experience (Grove, 1995). This
structure allowed the CSU and others to focus on the needs of specific patient populations regardless
of location or type of service. It reduced the organizational unit to a more manageable size in which
problems could be more easily identified, analyzed, and solved by the people who were (1) the most
familiar with the specific needs of each type of patient and (2) the most capable of developing a solution.
Two groups provided the leadership for this new structure: The Strategic Governance Council and
the Program Meeting. These groups comprised representatives from all areas of oncology. The Strategic
Governance Council addressed issues of strategic direction and included the most senior physician
from each of the major areas of oncology in addition to the senior administrator from the service line,
physician practice plan, oncology clinics, and oncology outreach program. This council set the strategic
direction and approved all plans in a well-defined planning process. The Program Meeting led the
operational implementation of the strategies and plans created by the Strategic Governance Council
and further served as the central forum for communication of strategic priorities and progress reports
on major projects and issues for all oncology operations throughout the hospital system.
Critical factors contributing to the successful creation of this new structure included agreement
on planning processes and sufficient resourcing by centralized services such as informatics, finance,
clinical laboratories, pharmacy, and radiology. The creation of the new model resulted in significant
improvements in communication, planning, and resource management; cooperation among the many
stakeholders; shared decision making regarding strategic and operational plans; expedited operational
problem resolution; and a dramatic financial improvement in the service line overall.

collaboratively provide multidisciplinary care
for a heterogeneous oncology patient population. While these individuals guide their individual programs’ operations on a daily basis,
these program leaders are unified under the
constructs of the Strategic Governance Council and the Program Meeting, where the roles
and influence of each are formalized, and
they are each able to communicate in a fairly
respectful and egalitarian environment. These

forums provide information to the Oncology
Leadership Group, which distills the information of the larger forums into guiding principles and strategies for oncology services as
a whole. While the Leadership Group has a
physician head who holds authority within the
group, it is not possible to say that this position holds unilaterally directive authority over
all the programs. The position and indeed the
group serve to integrate the perspectives and

196

Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement

needs of the multidisciplinary programs and
as such provide continuity and uniformity
of vision, strategy, and upward and outward
communication for oncology services as they
seek to continuously improve clinical care and
the health care experience for the oncology
patient population.
We can see that the style of leadership
most appropriate in QI is one that emphasizes participation and that builds trust among
team members. It is a style that encourages
members to express their views and to take
risks, and that develops the team and helps it
to become mature and more effective. All of
these characteristics can be seen in the Jones
Hospital oncology service line. Leadership
must also focus on keeping people engaged,
motivated, and stimulated to create and innovate. Quality improvement teams are, if not
voluntary, dependent upon the goodwill of
participants for their success. Some successful
teams encourage shared leadership by allowing specific individuals on a team to take on
leadership roles for particular phases of the
QI process. The overall leader therefore also
assumes a training role, helping to develop
team members’ skills in team leadership and
project management.
In sum, a participative leadership style is
required not because it is humane and fosters a
happy workforce (although it is likely to do so),
but because team members’ active participation is absolutely essential to success. Because
QI teams often do not exist within the formal
hierarchical structure of the organization,
team leaders must be conscious of the impact
of formal and informal lines of authority, on
team member motivation and commitment.

Communication Networks and
Interaction Patterns
A key maintenance task in any team is the
exchange of information. Methods of communication are essential and central in any team
activity, whether it is an operating room team, a

string quartet, a sports team, or a QI team. Communication is necessary not only within the
team but also between the team and the larger
external environment, including other teams.
Communication is critical and cannot be
left to chance. Consider the consequences, for
example, of there being no formal means of
communication between attending physicians
and nursing staff in a hospital—or if there
were no forum for communication among the
30 or more oncology programs at Jones Hospital. This is actually what drove Jones Hospital to completely restructure its organization
to a service-line format. Communication
and coordination deficiencies were identified as the underpinning factors contributing
to less-than-optimal performance, declining
patient care coordination and patient satisfaction, and a perception of reduced quality of care.
In any team, information must be conveyed, and a key question is, how? And how
effectively and accurately is the information
that is being exchanged? A key concept to help
with understanding how to achieve the highest levels of communication is that information exchange requires responsibilities of both
the sender and receiver of information. This
is especially true in teams where exchanges
between team members and team leaders do
not rely solely on the hierarchy implied by a
team structure, but also on the expertise of
each team member. One way to ensure optimal exchange between senders and receivers
of information is to make use of the important concept of active listening. Active listening requires drawing out of opinions of fellow
team members, through open and deliberative stances that are nonjudgmental, and
may require asking clarifying questions and
other skills to reduce distortions that prevent
mutual understanding. This idea relates not
only to team members listening carefully to
each other, but also to external stakeholders
(Sapienza, 2004).
To ensure that communication is carried
out in the most effective manner, teams—and
especially QI teams—require a communication

Team Processes

structure. Interestingly, a substantial proportion of health care quality problems reside
in communication structure problems in
the organization. Communication networks
come in several varieties, and each situation
demands a different type of communication
structure (Longest & Young, 2006). Where the
team task is simple, it may be most efficient to
use a centralized structure in which information passes from the team leader to other team
members. Alternatively, information can be
passed from the team leader to another team
member who, in a hierarchical manner, passes
it down to the next individual. Neither of these
models allows for or encourages upward communication. In other teams, one individual
assumes the role of network hub and communicates with other members. Information
from team members must pass through the
hub in order to reach other team members.
An all-channel communication structure is
dense; communication lines are open and
encouraged between all members of the team
(Longest & Young, 2006). Such a structure is
most useful for complex situations where the
work of each team member is interdependent
with others’ work. In such situations, formal
lines of authority are blurred or meaningless.
In teams focused on patient care, QI, research,
or management, it is important for team
members to have ready access to other team
members, as is seen in the service line of Jones
Hospital, which provides such access through
formalized communication forums. Information is passed not only from the team leader
but also among team members, making centralized models inappropriate. Similarly, going
through an intermediary is inefficient and may
use up valuable time.
Quality improvement activities require a
rich and dense communication structure. The
work of QI teams is complex, and communication lines must be open between all members. For example, an intervention aimed at
decreasing waiting time in a clinic requires
interaction between clinicians on the team,
support staff within the clinic, those involved

197

in data collection, and so forth. The leader of
such a team would assume the important role
of ensuring that communication networks are
in fact open and that team members are able to
communicate with each other.
Communication between a team and its
external environment is also important. As an
open system, teams are often dependent upon
other individuals and other teams inside or
outside the organization. Leaders here assume
boundary-spanning roles, in which they
ensure that relationships with critical outside
groups are workable (Longest & Young, 2006).
This is particularly important in a hospital setting, where a particular work unit’s operations
are highly dependent upon interactions with
other units (for example, patient-care units
are highly dependent upon the pharmacy,
dietary department, and so forth). The Oncology Leadership Group fills this role within the
oncology service line at Jones Hospital. The
Leadership Group is the broker between
the oncology department and the medical
center’s senior administration for such needs
as major redeployments of resources to support oncology’s strategic priorities, redesign
and reallocation of clinical space, or needs
for changes in the operational interface with
independent departments such as Pharmacy
Services, which, to fit strategic and political
needs, maintains an independent departmental structure in the organization. A QI team
likely relies on information and resources from
outside the immediate team and just as communication networks among team members
are critical, so are strong and reliable networks
between the team and other units and teams.
An isolated team that neglects its external relations is likely to perform poorly because key
relationships will not be well managed.

Decision Making
Decision making is a task of all teams, and the
manner in which decisions are made is critical to team success. Ideally, a formal systematic approach starting with free discussion and

198

Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement

ending with full support of the entire team is
a goal to be strived for in making team decisions (Grove, 1995). There are various ways to
achieve this ideal, but in some cases, full consensus cannot always be achieved or needed to
make correct decisions. Teams may reach decisions by consensus or voting, or team members
may simply advise the team leader, leaving the
final decision to the leader. There is no single,
best way for a team to make decisions, and the
mode of decision making often depends upon
the circumstances and goals of the team. The
president of a hospital, for example, may charge
a team with the task of analyzing an acquisition
possibility. The team may return with recommendations and options, but the final decision
and accountability for consequences remains
with the president. In a multidisciplinary
mental health treatment team, it is likely that
decisions will be based on team consensus,
although the team leader (who may be the psychiatrist) may reserve the right to override the
team’s recommendations. In still other teams,
particularly those where there is no single person in a position of formal authority, the team
as a whole may make decisions. In such situations, team members should discuss how decisions are to be made—by voting, by working
toward consensus and compromise, or perhaps
by deferring to the individual most knowledgeable about a particular issue to be decided.
In the Jones Hospital example (Case Study
6.4), the decision-making process and the people who make the decisions are highly dependent on the decisions themselves. Depending
on the nature and criticality of the issue at hand,
there are decisions made by formal vote in the
Strategic Governance Council, by informal consensus in the Program Meeting, and by mandate in the Leadership Group. The success of
such decision making is dependent upon open
communication among the members of these
groups; all information is shared, and a record
of decisions made is kept through meeting minutes of all bodies. When an individual has a
problem with a decision made by the Leadership
Group, for example, the forum for discussion of

such concerns is formally built in to the service
line structure via the other two groups.
Regardless of the mode of decision making,
it is critical that team members understand their
role in decision making. Assuming an advising
rather than decision-making role is acceptable
to team members as long as they do not expect
to be in the position of making decisions. The
decisional authority of the team and that of
team members needs to be specific and clear.
Teams often strive for cohesion, and in general cohesion is a positive force. Efforts should
be made to develop a team such that members
understand each other, are at ease communicating with each other, and feel a unified sense
of purpose and solidarity. Taken to an extreme,
however, cohesion can develop into conformity and “groupthink,” where team members
become so cohesive that they lose their independence as free thinkers and may fear expressing views opposed to what they consider to be
the prevailing team consensus (Daft, 2015).

Member and Team Learning
Peter Senge popularized the idea of the learning
organization in his book The Fifth Discipline
(1990). Briefly, a learning organization is one
that proactively creates, acquires, and transfers
knowledge and changes its behavior on the
basis of new knowledge and insights (Garvin,
1993). The implication of this definition for
teams is clear. First, effective teams continuously look for new information to improve
their performance, whether new technology,
new organizational processes, or new concepts. They are open to new ideas and seek
them out. They do this by seeking diversity
among team members, including people on
teams with new expertise and alternative perspectives, and by ensuring that team members
are engaged in continuous training and learning. Effective teams then attempt to use new
information, ensuring that new knowledge is
transferred to the team. This new knowledge
is then used to change the team’s behavior in
pursuit of higher levels of achievement. Teams

may enhance their ability to learn and apply
new knowledge through the use of a number
of facilitating factors, including scanning the
environment for new information; identifying
performance gaps within the team; adopting
an “experimental mindset,” such that team
members are open to new approaches; and
having leadership supportive of change. (See
Moingeon & Edmondson [1996] for a more
in-depth discussion of facilitating factors.)
Team and organizational learning are key
aspects of QI, and it is no surprise that the
capacity to learn is a hallmark of effective QI
teams (Upshaw, Steffen, & McLaughlin, 2013).
A QI team is faced not only with solving
problems, but also with the responsibility for
helping the larger organization transition into
a learning organization. Effective QI teams
review their own performance and the satisfaction of members and seek to develop strategies and new team management techniques
that will enhance their performance. Some
teams “debrief ” after each meeting to review
the progress of their work and the manner in
which they worked and seek to learn from this
and improve their capabilities. Learning from
experience and learning from the broader

external environment are trademarks of
effective organizations and teams.

Conclusions

In this chapter, we have reviewed the importance of teams and effective teamwork in
health care and most importantly in regard to
the successful implementation of QI efforts.
Steps in team development and team processes
were reviewed; these include development of
balanced team relationships and equal status to
ensure participation of all team members, and
open communication and feedback, which will
ensure efficient team performance through
empowerment and high levels of motivation.
Critical to the success of any team effort is
the role of team leaders, who can come from
within the team or from traditional leadership
positions; also critical to success is developing
a team’s culture. Finally, ongoing team learning was described as one of the most important aspects of teamwork in CQI; it provides a
means for sharing knowledge and improving
performance of a team as well as the larger
organization in which the team exists.

The Role of the Patient
in Continuous Quality
Improvement

(Canadian physician, 1849–1919)

H

ealth systems and services around
the world have one primary function: to care for the health and
well-being of individuals and populations in
the most effective way possible. This is true
whether the people are working in a laboratory, managing a hospital, triaging at an
accident or disaster site, performing cardiac
surgery, or counseling a patient with schizophrenia. Whatever the setting or service, the
measures of quality for the professional, staff
member, team, ward, and/or service are clear.
Such measures are established by a range
of mechanisms, including legislation, regulatory practice, professional registration,
peer and management review, government

and organizational policies, guidelines, and
research, and evidence-based practice.
Despite all best efforts over the last
15 years, the role of the patient (and the patient’s
family and carers) in maintaining and improving the quality of health care remains poorly
understood (Peat et al., 2010; Schwappach,
2010). This lack of clarity arises from three
sources. First, at least in part, the lack of clarity
is a result of the historical, political, organizational, and managerial agendas that converge
on this issue, making it difficult to define and
compare the different logics, types and levels
of approaches across services, systems and
countries (Tritter, 2009). Second, while there
exist a wide variety of policies (including, in
some cases, no policy at all) and mechanisms,
methods, and tools aimed at increasing patient
involvement in health care, there is very limited evidence addressing their role specifically
in quality improvement. As Groene and Sunol
(2015) argue, patient engagement “… takes
multiple forms in health care and there is not
201

202

Chapter 7 The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement

a single strategy or method that can be considered to reflect best practice” (p. 563).
Third, it remains difficult to connect
patient involvement in health care services and
the quality of outcomes either for particular
individuals or for patients in general.
While this lack of clarity can make the
involvement of consumers in quality improvement difficult, it does not negate the importance of their involvement in continuous
quality improvement (CQI). One of the markers of CQI, compared to other quality systems,
is that CQI acknowledges customer input as
a vital source of evidence at every step of the
improvement process. At an institutional level,
health care services have sought information
from customers through surveys, market
research, advertising, and outreach efforts.
From the health customer perspective, feedback is often measured via word of mouth
referrals, complaints, service reputation, service demand, and litigation.
The value of these sources of information is unquestionable. Patient or consumer
“involvement” in health care, however, is about
more than the collection of patient satisfaction
surveys. There is an increasing recognition
that efforts to increase the safety and improve
the quality of care have mainly focused at the
technical, managerial, or professional levels.
These approaches tended to leave both the
patient and the wider community outside of
the improvement processes. A meta-analysis of
eight public inquiries into large-scale breaches
of patient safety around the world showed that
there were common features in the breakdown
of care. Despite the diversity of country of origin, health care system, type of error(s), and
clinicians involved, several key themes were
identified across the inquiries. These themes
included a lack of patient and family involvement; poor communication and teamwork;
and inadequate quality monitoring processes
(Hindle et al., 2006). This confluence of factors
points clearly to the importance of the integral
involvement of patients in the CQI process.
The question remains, however: How do we

best gain and maximize the benefit from the
active involvement of patients in the quality
improvement process?
In this chapter, we begin by reviewing the
rationale, models, mechanisms, and current
evidence base for patient involvement in quality improvement. We then present a model of
patients’ involvement in health care that defines
three dimensions (active to passive involvement,
proactive to reactive responses, and micro to
macro levels). Lastly, we consider the barriers to
involvement in CQI of patients—especially vulnerable patients—and the ways in which health
care services can address this issue.

Patient Involvement
in Health Care
Improvement: A Brief
Overview

The call for active patient involvement in CQI
activities is in line with changes to the “traditional” patient–clinician relationship that
have occurred over several decades. This space
for engagement emerged as a consequence of
broader social changes. We briefly consider five
such changes that impacted the way in which
not only patients but health care as a whole
was perceived. These changes included shifts
in social structures, which in turn have had an
effect on the patient–clinician relationship.
From the late 1960s onward, individuals
and groups became more critical of institutions of power, including medicine and health
care (Illich, 1974). A greater questioning of
the relationship between medical practitioners
and their patients as well as other clinicians has
led to a decline (albeit a slow one) in medical
and provider dominance (Dent, 2006; Wade &
Halligan, 2004). The increasing diversity of
the health professions has also meant that the
disciplinary scope of the health sciences has
expanded, along with types and numbers of
services available (Borthwick et al., 2010).

Patient Involvement in Health Care Improvement: A Brief Overview

Several unforeseen global developments
also contributed to a shift in the perceived
location of health expertise. The emergence
of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s produced profound
social and clinical changes. Because of the rate
of this condition’s progression, the patients
themselves knew more about the illness than
the clinicians and researchers, introducing the
concept of the lay (or patient) expert (Epstein,
1995). The slow response to the scale and
severity of AIDS saw some significant shifts in
political policy generally and health policy in
particular. Not only did communities become
directly engaged in providing education about
and treatment of the disease, but the attitudes
and responses of health services and governments to patient involvement also changed as
powerful community lobby groups emerged
(Shilts, 2007).
Similar trends developed in the United
States in the 1990s relative to information services that became available to cancer patients
and other seriously ill patients. These services
continue to be rich sources of patient information, leading to greater patient empowerment.
For example, the U.S. National Cancer Institute sponsors a “Cancer Information Service”
that allows patients direct access to the latest
information by cancer site and type, providing access to both physician- and patient-level
information, including information on treatment options, treatment centers, and the latest news about clinical trials. These services
can be accessed utilizing multiple modes:
telephone (1-800-4-Cancer), the Internet, and
more recently, social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook. These services
provide patients with the knowledge to help
choose and even direct the level of care they
are receiving, ensuring the highest level of
quality and thereby playing a direct role in
quality improvement.
The politicization of various social groups
and their efforts to reestablish and legitimize
their medical traditions as part of their disenfranchised cultures and epistemologies have
contributed to the growth in calls for direct

203

patient involvement in the governance of health
care. These have combined with a growing
recognition of the impact produced by differences in these groups access to and quality of
care (Betancourt & King, 2003). The concept
of cultural safety in health care was developed
by the Irihapeti Ramsden in New Zealand and
has now spread internationally as a way of
conceptualizing the importance of indigenous
perspectives, ideas, and values in health care
systems. Ramsden’s argument was that health
care systems were already political and that for
disenfranchised peoples to have their perspectives acknowledged by these systems was, in
actuality, a political act of both self-definition
and resistance (Ramsden, 1993, 2000a, 2000b).
The growth in “alternative” or complementary medicine since the 1980s has been
associated with both globalization and the
dissatisfaction felt by many people with mainstream medical care. It has, in effect, produced
a secondary health care system, one more
directly controlled by the consumer and their
preferences (Mak & Faux, 2010; Senel, 2010).
The emergence of invigorated cultural health
traditions means that mainstream systems
need to address demands for the improved
recognition and inclusion of, for example,
traditional healers, medicines, and conceptual health schemata in treatment regimens
(Gottlieb, Sylvester, & Eby, 2008). Where medical systems have resisted these shifts, they
have often been forced by political pressure
and policy shifts to make some accommodations of these more patient-centered and
patient-driven approaches.
Lastly, the arrival of the Internet has
changed patients’ access to information in
quite profound ways. Patients now have readily
accessible information about their conditions
from an expanding range of sources (Bylund
et al., 2010). They can also gain information
about the treatments, services, or clinicians
available locally, nationally, and internationally. The media, both public and private, now
produce or host regular information programs,
websites, and columns addressing health care

204

Chapter 7 The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement

concerns, treatments, and services. In addition
to breaking news stories, there is now a constant stream of health-related programs ranging from documentaries to “reality” television
programs on hospitals and clinicians, all the
way to the cult of the celebrity clinician (e.g.,
Crouch et al., 2016; Jeong & Lee, 2017). Medicine has gone from the rarefied and private to
the increasingly commonplace and public.
It is not only patients and the media who
make use of these technologies. Health departments and services exhibit growing use of
websites and social networking sites to distribute information. Prominent clinicians also use
the technology; for example, Atul Gawande, a
leading patient safety researcher, has a regular
column in The New Yorker. Other researchers
and practitioners use iTunes to disseminate
their messages to clinicians and patients alike.
The Institute for Healthcare Improvement
(IHI) offers an online interprofessional educational community for clinicians and students
wanting to learn more about quality and safety.
For patients, the Internet has produced
another profound effect. It has become a
platform through which support and discussion groups have emerged. Even individuals
with the rarest of conditions (given access to
computers and the Internet) now have access
to forums where they can describe and discuss both the symptoms and the progression
of their illness; moreover, they can compare
the type and quality of their treatments with
patients experiencing the same or related conditions. Similarly, people acting as carers for
patients who may be too ill to seek their own
information directly can also seek support and
assistance from people in similar situations.

Rationale for Patient
Involvement in CQI

As social and clinical relationships were changing, there was also increasing public awareness
and disquiet about the incidence of medical

errors. Most quality and safety practitioners and
academics in the United States associate the birth
of the current patient safety movement with
the Institute of Medicine’s To Err Is Human
report (IOM, 2000). Although it was presenting
data about error rates from a much earlier study
by Brennan et al. (1991), the IOM report galvanized health care systems around the world into
action; the report’s metaphor of hospital errors
being the equivalent of a “jumbo jet full of
patients crashing every three days” drew widespread media and public attention.
Around the same time, a series of highprofile cases of negligence, incompetence,
and/or medical homicide began to appear
in the press. The Bristol Royal Infirmary
inquiry (pediatric cardiac surgery) and Shipman inquiry (general practice) in the United
Kingdom (Department of Health, 2001;
Smith, 2005), the Cartwright inquiry (cervical
screening) in New Zealand (Cervical Cancer
Inquiry, 1988), and the Manitoba Coroner’s
Inquest (pediatric cardiac surgery) in Canada
(Sinclair, 1994) were just some of the cases
that increased public anxiety about the quality and safety of health care internationally.
More recently, the Mid-Staffordshire Hospital
Inquiry in the United Kingdom has shown the
devastating impact of a lack of quality control
(Francis, 2013). Added to these two factors
were rising levels of complaints and litigation
faced by health services, both public and private. The scene was set for new approaches to
safeguarding patients.
Early on in the development of the patient
safety movement, Vincent and Coulter (2002)
asked the question “Patient safety: what
about the patient?” Their argument was that
“… plans for improving safety in medical care
often ignore the patient’s perspective” (p. 76)
and that the active role of patients in the safety
of their care was something that health care
services and clinicians needed to acknowledge
and encourage.
Patient involvement in CQI and other quality and safety strategies therefore reflects a profound change in the health service approaches

Methods for Involving Patients in CQI

to the provision of care. Health systems and
clinicians now recognize that patients and their
families can no longer be treated as completely
passive recipients of care. In addition to the
ethics involved in this traditional approach,
this new perspective has a strong practical element. Patient involvement is about ensuring
the accountability and transparency of services
(Emanuel & Emanuel, 1997; Forrest, 2004). It
is about the provision of patient-centered, as
opposed to clinician-centered, care (Berntsen,
2006; Robb et al., 2006, Kitson et al., 2013), to
the point more recently where health care services and clinicians have begun to work collaboratively on the codesign (Donetto et al.,
2015), coproduction (Batalden et al., 2016),
and redesign (Baker et al., 2016) of health care
services and programs. But it is equally about
joining with patients as partners in the constant
vigilance and heedfulness required to protect
against errors. Simply stated, practitioners, services, and managers needed to more actively
listen to and engage with patients throughout
the entire health care process.

▸

Methods for Involving
Patients in CQI

What does patient involvement look like?
The answer depends largely on the level and
type of system under consideration. One way
of assessing patient involvement in CQI is to
focus on three levels [after Bronfenbrenner
(1979)]: micro (direct clinician–patient interactions), meso (health service or system level),
and macro (national or international).

Micro-Level Patient Involvement
At a micro level, patients are directly involved
in the decision making and management plans
associated with their individual treatment, as
well as in ensuring that the intended treatment
is given as planned and according to established protocols (that is, in the monitoring of

205

the quality and safety of their care) (Longtin
et al., 2010; Peat et al., 2010). Here, terms such
as engaged, active, vigilant, or empowered are
applied to the patient as health services seek to
assist patients in improving their health literacy and supporting them, wherever possible,
to take on a self-management role (Anderson,
2007; Coulter & Elwyn, 2002; Entwistle &
Quick, 2006).
Over the last decade the idea of personalization has been introduced and is closely
associated with the CQI concept of mass customization (McLaughlin & Kaluzny, 2006).
Personalization is a term that has been used
in various industries, especially the computer
industry. The association between personalization and mass customization is discussed in
detail by Tseng and Piller (2003), who describe
personalization as going beyond the traditional definition of customization by involving
customers (patients) in intense communication and high levels of interaction (between
customers and suppliers), including negotiating the selection of services with the customer
(see Chapter 1). This terminology has begun
to be adopted in medical care (Hamburg &
Collins, 2010), by expanding the inclusion
of patient preferences through the individualization of care and shared decision making
(Barratt, 2008; Robinson et al., 2008).
Patients are increasingly involved in collaborating with clinicians to reach accurate
diagnoses, decide on appropriate treatment
and/or management strategies, choose a suitably experienced and safe provider, and in
ensuring the appropriate administration and
monitoring of, and adherence to, treatments
or directions (DiGiovanni, Kang, & Manuel,
2003; Ubbink et al., 2009). At this level, patients
can also contribute to reducing the inappropriate use of health care resources (such as the
overuse of medications, including antibiotics),
which in turn can potentially reduce health care
errors (Smith, 2009) and the spread of antimicrobial resistance (McCullough et al., 2015).
Patients have increasingly been called on
to identify and notify unsafe acts on the part

206

Chapter 7 The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement

of clinicians, including, for example, a lack
of hand hygiene (Bittle & LaMarche, 2009;
Seale et al., 2015). As with self-management
of chronic conditions, patients are most often
encouraged to participate in quality improvement programs through a combination of
awareness raising, information, and educational programs (Anthony et al., 2003), including participation in social marketing programs
(see Chapter 8).

Meso-Level Patient Involvement
At the meso level, patient involvement in CQI
is about increasing the appropriate, effective,
and safe provision of services (Bate & Robert,
2016). As consumers or customers, patients
involved at this level are engaged in the planning, management, and evaluation of anything
from entire health systems (Mockford et al.,
2012) down to individual services (Donetto
et al., 2015). Such participation can also take a
variety of forms.
Individuals can be involved as members of
the public, as patients, as caregivers or family
members of individuals receiving care, as representatives of consumer organizations (such
as advocacy and self-help groups), and as members and representatives of population groups
or communities (Anderson, Shepherd, &
Salisbury, 2006; Murray, 2015). The perceived
effectiveness of this last type of participation
has been attributed (by patients) to their own
participatory behavior and the availability of
institutional participatory spaces—that is, the
“opening up” of CQI mechanisms to patient
involvement (Delgado-Gallego & Vazquez,
2009). It is important to note that there are
criticisms of the “representativeness” of consumers, in particular that the patients involved
tend to be either “professional” consumers or
individuals who often more closely mirror
the socioeconomic and educational profiles of
health care professionals than of other social
groups (Coulter, 2002).
The mechanisms by which they are
involved also vary. Participation can be a

“one-off ” involvement in a forum or workshop or attendance at a conference. Participation can occur in time-limited activities, such
as membership on patient safety committees
in hospitals or services, although it should
be noted that there is evidence for discrepancies between the patients’ and staff ’s expectations of this engagement process (Nathan,
Johnston, & Braithwaite, 2010). Participation
can also be anonymous and more passive or
reactive. Feedback via patient satisfaction surveys (see Chapter 4), exit interviews, or questionnaires can contribute to quality efforts, as
can involvement in focus groups or complaints
and compliments letters (Ervin, 2006; Mease
et al., 2007). Once again, this level of involvement may be part of a social marketing initiative, as described in Chapter 8.

Macro-Level Patient Involvement
Macro-level involvement in CQI sees the
patient involved in patient safety activities
at a national or international level. Various
examples exist and are discussed in the following sections. The World Health Organization’s (WHO) Patients for Patient Safety
movement is one example of an international
strategy aimed at ensuring that the patient’s
perspective is integrated into mechanisms
to improve the quality and safety of care.
The WHO’s London Declaration is a pledge
of partnership and a core document for its
World Alliance for Patient Safety (Patients for
Patient Safety, 2006).
For both publicly and privately funded
health care around the world, public reporting on the quality of care remains a contested
issue (Duckett et al., 2008). The argument
for the publication of such data is that it will
make patients (often, in this context, referred
to as consumers) more active participants in
their choice of providers (Utzon & Kaergaard,
2009). Effective public reporting is said to (1)
engage and involve health care systems and
services from the initiation of the reporting

the highest quality, (3) provide information
in a way that is accessible and appropriate
to consumers, and (4) to provide clinicians
with detailed information on their individual performance (Tu & Lauer, 2009). Finally,
in addition to input into direct service and
health system delivery issues, some countries
are grappling with the involvement of consumers and the public in “upstream” areas of
patient safety such as health-related research
(Forsythe, 2016).

Factors Affecting
Patient Involvement

What evidence is available to support the
involvement of patients in the quality and
safety of care? Rigorous evaluations of both
educational campaigns (Schwappach, 2010)
and patient involvement programs (Peat et al.,
2010) were found to be lacking. Available evidence indicates that although patients tend to
have a positive attitude toward the idea of being
involved in their safety, their actual involvement varies both as individuals (Schwappach,
2010) and between groups, particularly in the
case of “minority” groups, such as immigrants
(De Freitas & Martin, 2015).
From the patients’ perspective, a number
of factors contribute to their willingness to
participate in patient safety and quality strategies. These include their sense of self-efficacy;
their acceptance of a new, more active role as
patients; the perceived preventability of incidents; and the perceived effectiveness of their
actions (Peat et al., 2010; Schwappach, 2010).
Health literacy is a significant factor in
determining patient involvement at every
level of care (Kripalani et al., 2010; Pappas
et al., 2007; Peota, 2004; Rothman et al., 2009).
Factors inhibiting patient involvement range
from the complexity of the patient’s condition
(e.g., the presence of comorbidities) to a perceived lack of confidence or skills, to broader
socioeconomic issues including social status

207

and ethnicity (Johnstone & Kanitsaki, 2009;
Longtin et al., 2010). The health care setting
(e.g., whether it is primary, secondary, or tertiary care, or whether the patient perceives it to
be intimidating) and the actual task involved
(e.g., whether “involvement” includes confronting clinicians) have also been found to
contribute to patients’ willingness and ability to participate in CQI-related strategies
(Burroughs et al., 2005; Davis et al., 2007). Perceived power differentials between individuals
from vulnerable communities and health services can cause anxiety, including fear of retribution. So too can the burden of being asked to
represent the needs and concerns of an entire
community, especially without adequate skills,
support, or preparation (Abelson et al., 2004;
Arnstein, 1969; Delgado-Gallego & Vazquez,
2009; Murie & Douglas-Scott, 2004).
The type of illness being experienced
and socioeconomic factors also contribute to
health workers’ support of patient involvement.
Clinicians’ attitudes toward patient involvement
are influenced by organizational issues (e.g.,
lack of time or training) and personal beliefs;
for example, they may fear losing control or
specialization, or they may perceive the “stakes”
as being too high (Longtin et al., 2010). Thus,
the integration of patient involvement still has
some way to go before it is central to CQI and
related processes.

▸

Measuring Patient
Involvement in CQI

In keeping with the London Declaration,
patient satisfaction surveys have been implemented in many countries in an effort to
quantify some of the many nonclinical outcomes of the patient experience and to try and
increase the transparency of health and medical treatments and their associated outcomes.
There is an ongoing debate about whether
“satisfaction” is an adequate conceptual framework for what is at stake, and other terms such

208

Chapter 7 The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement

as patient experiences have been proposed
(Hekkert et al., 2009). The use of “satisfaction” measures also indicates the influence of
established models in the corporate world for
gaining feedback from those paying for and/
or receiving the service in question. The type
of data collected lends itself to the statistical analysis of key institutional issues against
patients’ demographic variables, with a prevailing assumption that objective, quantifiable
data provide the necessary understanding. An
important constraint is that most satisfaction
surveys tend to produce relatively positive
results, and institutional providers may themselves be dependent on positive indicators for
funding, board approvals, and other systemic
“rewards.”
Thus, measuring CQI from the patient
perspective is more complicated than it may
initially appear. It is also clear that patient
experiences, satisfaction included, can be
highly individual, contextual, and fundamentally phenomenological in character—falling
into the problematic “subjective” domain.
Even patient responses to adverse events, up to
and including disability or death, can be seen
to vary enormously depending on how the
health care providers respond to those errors.
Consequently, the science of patient involvement generally—and patient “satisfaction” as
a particular dimension of that experience—
relies on a much broader understanding of
what knowledge we are seeking, why we are
seeking it, and how we go about acquiring the
information to construct that knowledge. To
rely exclusively, or even mainly, on standard
quantitative measures in the highly contextualized settings that health care involves (think
appendectomy vs. chemotherapy, for example)
requires a richer and more sophisticated information base than generally produced from
(typically) closed-ended survey instruments
(see Chapter 4).
In the broader context, and given the
information presented in this chapter,
health care experiences do not, and realistically cannot, exist on the same level as

consumer-durable purchases and they must
be seen as possessing a richer set of conceptual and psychometric properties. As a result,
we need to acknowledge that our science of
measurement in patient involvement and satisfaction needs to address that multilayered
complexity more directly and informatively.
In essence, there are many more potential
opportunities for more direct patient and
caregiver involvement.

▸

The M-APR Model of
Patient Involvement

Drawing on the evidence base, we have developed a model of patient involvement that
spans all levels and types of health care. The
M-APR model of patient involvement looks at
this issue across three levels—the “Ms” (e.g.,
micro, meso, macro) —and across two dimensions of involvement, the “APR” (e.g., active/
proactive and passive/reactive involvement).
These dimensions indicate that patient, family, and public involvement and/or feedback
into CQI can be more fully achieved through a
variety of mechanisms.
Active participation assumes the direct
and ongoing involvement of patients and
their families and caregivers in CQI activities,
be it direct input and decision making about
patients’ individual care or the determination
of ethical standards for professions or services.
Passive involvement sees services and systems
drawing on more removed, yet still useful,
sources of patient feedback. Many services
are most familiar, and comfortable, with these
sources, which include patient satisfaction
surveys, exit interviews, patient focus groups,
and more removed information provision via
service report cards.
In proactive involvement, the patient is
involved in attempting to actively prevent
errors and directly address safety issues.
These initiatives range from education and
involvement in confronting potential sources

The M-APR Model of Patient Involvement

of errors (e.g., addressing clinicians’ hand
hygiene or ensuring that the surgeon marks
the appropriate limb or side of the body to
be operated on), to involvement in CQI
strategies and programs at service levels, to
decision making about research directions
at state, national, or international levels. In
reactive approaches, the patient is involved
in identifying the causes of errors that have
already occurred, from the use of complaint
letters to the analysis of incident reports;
from involvement in root cause analysis
(RCA) programs to involvement in patient
safety inquiries.
M-APR is intended to be a diagnostic
rather than a prescriptive model. TABLE 7.1
shows a summary of the model, along with
some select examples. Examples, by necessity,
reflect differences in publicly versus privately
funded health systems.

Examples of Patient
Involvement in CQI
In this section, we provide an overview of four
very different strategies for patient involvement in CQI. These examples illustrate the different levels of the M-APR model and provide
insights into mechanisms by which patients
can contribute to ensuring the quality of
health care for themselves and for the broader
community.

Example 1: Partners in Health
For almost a decade, Kaiser Permanente in the
United States has been promoting its Patients
as Partners program. Led by Dr. David Sobel,
this program focuses on the direct involvement of patients with long-term health conditions in their self-management and health
literacy development. The concept is to reposition patients from being “consumers” of health
services to being active partners in their own
health treatment and management. The key
concept is that patients with chronic conditions are already essentially responsible for

209

80% of their own diagnostic and treatment
behaviors, and supporting this pattern can
potentially improve care and save time, money,
and resources.
This program grew out of work in the
1990s by Kate Lorig at the Stanford University
Center for Research in Patient Education on
a chronic disease self-management program
and patient outcomes. The program at Kaiser
includes the Healthwise Handbook, initially
available online, and a range of other print,
online, and direct, face-to-face supports. The
concept of making low- and high-intensity
interventions available was developed to cover
a wide range of potential supports that could
be adjusted to meet both patient and situational needs (e.g., clinician training, patient
mailings, telephone calls, and face-to-face support groups).
Kaiser Permanente produced evidence to
show that the strategy is highly effective and
has lasting effects for patients as well as health
service providers, including more appropriate
utilization of services, improved accessibility,
and measurable declines in selected types of
service utilization. Satisfaction and behavioral indicators were positive, and return-oninvestment measures ranged from 5:1 to 10:1
across the range of strategies. A randomized,
controlled trial compared program subjects
with wait-list controls. For participating
patients with conditions including lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis, the
results showed improvements over 6 months
in their exercise levels, their communication
with physicians, self-reported health, and
other measures. In addition, the program saw
reductions in the number of hospital, outpatient, and emergency room admissions (Lorig
et al., 1999). Although Kaiser is obviously a
very large and influential health care provider,
by its own estimate, up to 80% of the changes
it implemented could also be implemented by
smaller, less well-resourced providers where
economics of scale and integration factors
might not be as readily available (Sobel, 2003;
Sofaer et al., 2009).

Chapter 7 The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement

The M-APR Model of Patient Involvement

Example 2: National Patient
Safety Goals in the United States
A second example of a patient involvement
strategy is based on the accreditation requirements of health services and programs in the
United States. The Joint Commission (TJC)
has a specific National Patient Safety Goal
(NPSG 13) that addresses this issue. It states
that services should “encourage patients’ active
involvement in their own care as a patient
safety strategy,” with a more specific subclause
(NPSG.13.01.01) that they should “define and
communicate the means for patients and their
families to report concerns about safety and
encourage them to do so.” In 2010, this goal
became part of TJC’s standards for accreditation of health care services. TJC published its
Patients as Partners: Toolkit for Implementing
the National Patient Safety Goal in 2007. This
work grew out of the establishment of NPSG
13, which specifically addresses the idea of
patients and their families and caregivers as
having an important and tangible role in the
identification of potential errors in patient
treatment and care.
Patients as Partners has been supported
by a range of related publications aimed at
improving the capacity of patients and caregivers to identify patient safety issues as
they see them developing. The program also
involves training packages and accreditation
for health service providers, including strategies for implementing, monitoring, and evaluating their performance. As with other patient
safety systems around the world, being able to
capture data and quantify the results of interventions is a crucial aspect of systemic change
and program validation.
One of the key issues identified by TJC
has been the diversity of patients, families, and
caregivers in terms of their cultures and the
variety of languages spoken and read. The focus
on both English-language materials and materials for other important groups, such as Spanish
speakers, has been integrated into the focus of
this work. Central to this work is not simply

211

the shifting demographics of the United States
(and other immigrant-receiving countries) but
also the centrality of effective communication
in patient safety improvements. If patients are to
be actively engaged as partners, then key communication issues such as language have to be
incorporated from the beginning.
While TJC is not the only accreditation
organization in the United States, it is an
important organization, both nationally and
internationally, in promoting patient safety
and supporting the role of patients, families,
and caregivers in the processes associated with
patient safety’s systemic development (see
Chapter 12). The establishment of tangible
measures of patient involvement, in addition
to other indicators, means that patient involvement is more likely to occur and produce systemic change (The Joint Commission, 2010).

Example 3: Patients as
Partners Program
Impact British Columbia, a not-for-profit
health service provider organization specifically established to work across British
Columbia’s health system to support service
improvement, has recently implemented a
Patients as Partners program based on the
British Columbia Primary Health Care Charter. The charter is predicated on the understanding that only 15% of the population has
no engagement with the primary health care
system in any given year. One of the program’s
goals is therefore to raise the level of patient
involvement and self-management through
such means as outreach programs that people
can access from close to home. The training
programs include patients, caregivers, and
health care providers. In addition, while acute
care is a major focus of the health system generally, chronic conditions contribute to a large
proportion of the costs of health care and high
average costs per patient, especially when
patients with multiple conditions are more
effectively taken into account.

212

Chapter 7 The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement

The specified principles at Impact are as
follows:
■
■

■

■

People are treated with respect and dignity.
Health care providers communicate and
share complete and unbiased information
with patients and families in ways that are
affirmative and useful.
Individuals and families build on their
strengths through participation in
experiences that enhance control and
independence.
Collaboration among patients, families,
and providers occurs in policy and program development and professional education, as well as in the delivery of care.

The scope of the program aims to meet
tangible goals for improving patient access
to self-treatment programs, including training programs for both patients and staff on
self-management programs, patient satisfaction measures, and patient and staff confidence measures in utilizing the programs. The
focus is on British Columbians who are English
speakers, once again acknowledging the key
part that communication, more broadly, and
language, in particular, play in these processes
of patient engagement, empowerment, and
quality improvement.
Beyond the individual level, communities
are engaged in allowing providers to define
their local community and its constituents.
Broad targets are identified for outreach activities to community organizations and related
bodies (health and nonhealth) and for the
need to train health professionals in developing skills for community engagement (Impact
British Columbia, 2007).

Example 4: From Partners
to Owners
Historically, health services for native peoples in the United States were provided by
the U.S. Indian Health Service. This did not

produce successful outcomes for many groups,
including the Alaskan native communities,
regardless of how well-intentioned providers
were. The Southcentral Foundation (SCF) and
the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium
signed an agreement in 1999 taking over the
management of all Indian Health Service programs on the Alaska Native Health Campus
(ANHC). These included the Alaska Native
Medical Center (ANMC), the Native Primary
Care Center, and the Southcentral Foundation’s main administration building, as well as
other facilities based in Anchorage. The realization of the goal of health service ownership
by a not-for-profit organization has since seen
a significant philosophical and pragmatic shift
in the design and delivery of health care services to Alaskan native peoples seeking treatment at the SCF/ANHC services.
The reorientation has focused on the
owners/patients as the central component
in the health system’s design and delivery of
services. Native people were asked how they
would like care to be provided, and the results
have been substantial. Outcome measures
were included from the outset of the change
program, and key measures such as satisfaction (of patients and staff), access, quality, and
utilization are all very high. The change model
has also produced significant reductions in
features such as patient backlogs, HIV-positive
patient admissions, and emergency department admissions.
The shift from a “patient-centered” to
a “patient-driven” system has produced significant and meaningful changes across the
spectrum of Alaskan native health care and
established a model of innovation and change
management that is attracting national and
international attention. The direct and practical involvement of patients has improved
measures across all domains of care for both
patients and providers (Eby, 2007; Gottlieb,
2007; Gottlieb, Sylvester, & Eby, 2008; The
Southcentral Foundation, 2010).

Conclusions

We have shown here that the involvement of
patients in the health care that they receive
and in CQI is no longer in question. What is
also undisputed is that, despite a decade of
sustained effort by governments, services,
and clinicians, medical error rates have still
not significantly reduced (Wachter, 2010),
and a variety of disparities in both the quality
and accessibility of health care persist. Determining the best way to involve consumers in
reducing those errors, improving the quality of
care they receive, and maximizing the benefits
of that involvement, therefore remains problematic. Each health care system and service,

across the world, will rightly need to take into
account its unique funding and governance
structures, planning strategies, and quality
improvement mechanisms in deciding which
patient involvement strategy is most suitable
to its needs. Whatever the particulars involved,
whatever method or mechanism the service
chooses, it is clear that patients will have a
greater level of involvement in their care and
in ensuring higher quality. The years of token
involvement and a “one-size-fits-all” approach
are over. The question remains how health care
systems will more fully integrate patients into
their CQI initiatives and what actions they will
take to resolve persistent quality and safety
problems. Only then, we suggest, is it likely
that error rates will finally reduce.

CHAPTER 8

A Social Marketing Approach
to Increase Adoption
of Continuous Quality
Improvement Initiatives
Carol E. Breland and Mike Newton-Ward
The aim of marketing is to know and understand
the customer so well that the product or service
fits him or her and sells itself.
— Peter Drucker

I

magine a typical scenario in which hospital management has recently implemented a continuous quality improvement
(CQI) initiative to decrease the incidence of
hospital-acquired conditions in their intensive
care unit (ICU). Their data suggest that poor
hand-washing techniques by staff and bacteria on portable equipment are to blame. The
CQI plan is to provide hand-washing training, implement mandatory hand-washing for
doctors when entering and leaving a patient’s
room, and ensure more thorough cleaning of
portable X-ray machines that come into the
patients’ rooms.

However, patient occupancy at the hospital
has increased recently due to a closure of another
hospital nearby. The housekeeping staff is struggling to keep up with the demand, so staff members have responded by shortening the time
they spend cleaning rooms between patients.
The housekeeping personnel do not have time
to measure the disinfectant product they mix
with water, but do not want to run out, so they
just guess at a reduced amount, resulting in a less
effective cleaning product. They defer the floor
mopping, reasoning that the patient is not on the
floor, so its cleanliness will not matter anyway—
so every time someone drops something on the
floor, there is a risk of contamination. In addition, the cleaning staff has never been instructed
to clean the television remote-control device and
nurse call button, and thus infection-causing
agents are being transferred from patient to
patient via these objects.

Chapter 8 A Social Marketing Approach to CQI Initiatives

Without a better understanding of these
background issues, the CQI team will be disappointed in the latest data showing that infection rates have not decreased. A meeting might
be held to determine how to improve the process for hand-washing and how to check for
bacteria more often on equipment. Formal
brainstorming, perhaps using a traditional CQI
tool such as a fishbone diagram (see Chapter 4
for details) prior to the implementation phase
might have led to improved outcomes. Alternatively, or as an adjunct to brainstorming,
social marketing behavior theories and techniques could also have been used as a way to
ensure greater success by including formative
research and data gathered on multiple target
audiences. Using this process, the team might
have discovered that the housekeeping staff
was unknowingly undermining their efforts.
Through better understanding of the behavior of the housekeeping staff, a plan could be
developed to remove some of the barriers to
proper cleaning, such as having the disinfectant premeasured and stored nearby and having a separate designated mop team to ensure
that rooms are mopped thoroughly.
Social marketing is a behavioral change
methodology firmly planted in the theory and
processes of commercial marketing that can
be used in conjunction with other more traditional techniques to implement and help to
ensure the broadest acceptance and adoption
of innovations and changes, including CQI
initiatives. Because it is a unique application
in CQI, we will first define social marketing
concepts and processes. An excellent definition of social marketing is found in Nancy
R. Lee and Philip Kotler’s book Social marketing: Changing behaviors for good: “Social
marketing is a process that uses marketing
principles and techniques to change target
audience behaviors to benefit society as well
as the individual. This strategically oriented
discipline relies on creating, communicating,
delivering, and exchanging offerings that have
positive value for individuals, clients, partners, and society at large” (Lee & Kotler, 2016,

p. 9). Social marketing should not be confused
with communication-only campaigns that rely
on advertisements, public service announcements, or printed materials, but that do not
address the barriers and facilitators for behaviors. Also, social marketing is sometimes confused with social media marketing, a term that
describes the use in marketing campaigns of
social media networking sites such as Facebook
or Twitter (Uhrig et al., 2010). Social marketing provides a strategic framework for bringing
multiple interventions to bear on a problem,
while social media is a communication tactic.
The application of social marketing has
evolved since the 1970s, when the term social
marketing was first introduced by Philip Kotler
and Gerald Zaltman in the Journal of Marketing (Kotler & Zaltman, 1971). Over the past
45 years, the field has undergone continuous growth and refinement. This evolution
includes the extension of business concepts
of commercial marketing, which was the traditional form of marketing prior to the 1970s,
to nontraditional settings such as governmental and nongovernmental organizations and
to nontraditional fields such as public health,
public safety, and environmental quality. It
has also included internal growth through
lessons learned from ever-broadening applications within these nontraditional settings.
For example, during the 1980s, some major
health-related organizations, such as the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) and the World Health Organization
(WHO), began to consider implementing
social marketing concepts. The ideas spread
further in the 1990s when universities such
as the University of South Florida in Tampa,
Florida, and the University of Strathclyde in
Glasgow, Scotland, began to create academic
programs in social marketing (Lee & Kotler,
2016). The journal Social Marketing Quarterly was founded, and a pivotal text by Alan
Andreasen, Marketing social change: Changing
behavior to promote health, social development,
and the environment (Andreasen, 1995) was
introduced. Externally, social marketing has

Hallmarks of Social Marketing

benefited from advances in psychology, sociology, behavioral economics, communication,
and design thinking. The totality of this growth
has provided social marketers with a rich set
of diverse tactics for influencing behaviors that
yield beneficial societal outcomes.
Social marketing has produced some wellknown health behavior change campaigns, such
as the anti-tobacco “Truth” campaign (Evans
et al., 2002), the “VERB: It’s What You Do” adolescent physical activity campaign (Wong et al.,
2004), the “Save the Crabs, Then Eat ’Em” campaign for protecting the Chesapeake Bay area
(Landers et al., 2006), the “Back to Sleep” campaign for sudden infant death syndrome prevention (Cotroneo, Hazel, & Chapman, 2001), and
the “Click It or Ticket” campaign for seat belt use
to save lives (Williams, Wells, & Reinfurt, 2002).
A campaign to reduce the incidence and impact
of medical errors in hospitals, the “100,000
Lives Campaign of 2004” and the subsequent
“5 Million Lives Campaign” was conducted by
the Institute for Healthcare Improvement from
2004 to 2008 (Berwick, Calkins, McCannon, &
Hackbarth 2006; Berwick, 2014).

Hallmarks of Social
Marketing

It is important to note that social marketing uses the same fundamental concepts and
principles as commercial marketing (Siegel
& Doner, 1998). To further understand how
social marketing has evolved from these roots,
some understanding of traditional commercial
marketing is helpful. Commercial marketers
are experts at looking through the eyes of the
individual and seeing what drives that person’s
desire for a product. Commercial marketers
know, based on their audience research, that
the individual will keep trying to meet some
very basic human needs for acceptance and
success and will want to buy their product.
Social marketers can use these same techniques to meet some of the same desires but

219

by promoting voluntary behavior changes that
encourage healthy behaviors, better health
outcomes, true well-being, and a better society.
Central to all marketing is the concept of
exchange—the idea that people perceive barriers and benefits to acting in various ways,
and that they are more likely to act in ways
that have fewer barriers and greater benefits.
A central task of marketing, then, is to understand the perceived barriers and benefits and
to effect changes that lower the barriers and
increase the facilitators to action.
Commercial marketing and social marketing share other concepts but give different
emphases to the concepts. The most important
distinction between traditional commercial
marketing and social marketing is the product or service being sold. Social marketers
hope to promote (sell) a good behavior, with
no real goal of financial gain, while commercial marketers are focused on selling a good
or service, irrespective of its benefit to society,
for financial gain. Competition for the commercial marketer is usually another similar
product or company, whereas in social marketing, it is another (often unhealthy) behavior. For example, the social marketer working
on an anti-smoking campaign, perhaps in a
public health school or agency, is interested in
decreasing smoking behavior and replacing it
with a healthy behavior, such as smoking less
or stopping smoking. In contrast, marketers
who work for tobacco companies have a completely different goal, such as increasing use
of the particular brand of cigarettes that will
lead to the greatest profitability for the tobacco
company, which is the ultimate goal of most
commercial marketing campaigns. Commercial marketing employs a range of proven,
best practice concepts that are all essential in
creating an effective marketing campaign to
increase the use of a product and increase the
financial gain of a company. These techniques
include the marketing mix (the strategies of
Product, Price, Place and Promotion, known
as the “four P’s”), branding, exchange, audience research and segmentation, evaluation,

and monitoring. Social marketing uses the
same concepts but with the goal of gaining an
outcome that improves society—for example,
better health in a community.
The approach is summarized in The basics
of social marketing (Social Marketing National
Excellence Collaborative, 2002), in which the
authors introduce several important principles
(see BOX 8.1). Although the details may vary,
the goal of using social marketing to achieve
behavior change is “to figure out how to make
behavior change EASY, FUN, and POPULAR”
(Social Marketing National Excellence Collaborative, 2002).

Social Marketing
Applications to CQI
in Health Care

Why use social marketing, a discipline
designed for influencing health behaviors,
in CQI initiatives? As we have noted, there
are several parallels between CQI and the
approaches and methods of social marketing,
but these are just a starting point for where
social marketing can be applied to CQI in
health care. For example, one important starting point common to CQI and social marketing is understanding customer motivation and
needs. But social marketing also addresses an
important next step that is sometimes overlooked in CQI; that is, understanding and

removing barriers that have led to resistance
to implementing improvement initiatives,
similar to the factors that thwart innovation in
health care that were described in Chapter 2.
Social marketing is a methodology that draws
from human behavior theory; as humans are
involved in endeavors to improve quality not
only in industrial processes but in the provision of health services, it stands to reason that
social marketing techniques can be applied to
CQI initiatives that require behavior change,
by internal or external “customers.” Change
and improvement are the fundamental basis
of all CQI initiatives. As noted by Sollecito &
Johnson (2019, p. 6):
CQI is simultaneously two things:
a management philosophy and a
management method. It is distinguished by the recognition that the
customer requirements are the key
to customer quality and that customer requirements ultimately will
change over time because of changes
in evidence-based practices and associated changes in education, economics, technology, and culture. Such
changes, in turn, require continuous
improvements in the administrative
and clinical methods that affect the
quality of patient care. ... Change is
fundamental to the healthcare environment, and the organization’s systems must have both a will and the
way to master such change effectively.

Social Marketing Applications to CQI in Health Care

Traditionally, CQI approaches emphasize
managerial and professional processes to build
a structural framework to implement changes.
Individuals are needed to provide input into
what changes need to be made and the best
methods for changing them. In his plenary
address to the First Annual European Forum
on Quality Improvement in Health Care in
1996, Dr. Donald M. Berwick, then-President
of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement,
outlined some fundamental concepts needed
for change (Berwick, 1996, p. 619). The following quotes from his address are particularly
relevant to this discussion:
■
■

■

“Real improvement comes from changing
systems, not changing within systems.”
“To make improvement, we must be clear
about what we are trying to accomplish,
how we will know that a change has led
to improvement, and what change we can
make that will result in an improvement.”
“You win the Tour de France not by planning for years for the perfect first bicycle ride but by constantly making small
improvements.”

Other efforts of CQI are to deemphasize
individual blame, recognize individual contributions, decentralize responsibility, and rely
on hard data such as surveys, patient data, and
equipment costs in making decisions.
Similarly, social marketing emphasizes
first building a foundation for the change
framework using behavior change theories
and models such as the diffusion of innovation theory, the social norms theory, the health
belief model, the theory of planned behavior,
and the social cognitive theory to explore
the benefits, barriers, and competition of the
behavior change (Lee & Kotler, 2016). These
models seek to understand the readiness of
their audience to change, what perceptions
they have of the desired behavior change,
what the seriousness of the change is (what
will happen if the change does not occur), and
how they will be perceived by their peer group
if they change. By considering some of these

221

change models in implementing CQI initiatives, there is a much stronger understanding
of the motivations of those who are involved in
designing and implementing CQI.
The process of integration of behavior
change concepts to other disciplines such
as CQI is gaining momentum in the same
way that other CQI processes have evolved
exponentially in health care in the past several years. Nationally, social marketing has
already benefited the quality improvement
process. Between 2005 and 2007, the Social
Marketing National Excellence Collaborative trained staff from a majority of Quality
Improvement Organizations (QIOs) to apply
the social marketing process to the items in
their scope of work, developed by the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).
The collaborative conducted a series of trainings around the country. QIO staff created
social marketing plans for issues such as the
implementation of electronic medical records
by private physician practices, reduction of
pressure ulcers among nursing home patients,
improved management of oral medication in
home health clients, improved care of hospital patients with pneumonia, and improved
validity rate of chart abstracts submitted to
CMS (Rokoske, McArdle, & Schenck, 2012;
Schenck, McArdle, & Weiser, 2013).

Organizational Impacts on Social
Marketing Applications to CQI
in Health Care
When considering the application of social
marketing methods to health initiatives, it is
not just individual health behaviors that can be
improved by understanding and addressing the
factors that produce the behavior. Improvement
can also be addressed at the organization level.
Lee and Kotler (2016) encourage the application of social marketing in a wide variety of
settings and with upstream audiences such as
policymakers, corporations, law enforcement,
school districts, and non-profit organizations.

222

Chapter 8 A Social Marketing Approach to CQI Initiatives

For example, if refraining from smoking in the
workplace can become the standard of behavior through social marketing and public policy,
then it follows that health care practices can
improve, resulting in better patient outcomes,
through the same methods.
To illustrate how social marketing can
influence health care organizations, consider
the prevalent concern about infection control.
A common goal in all health care clinics is to
emphasize proper hand-washing behavior to
control the spread of infection (Dauer, 2007).
To encourage this behavior, health care providers are regularly trained on the importance
of hand-washing, and reminder messages are
usually posted near sinks. Thus, health care is
similar to other noncommercial settings that
can be described as having standards that are
based on behaviors that can be influenced
(for the good) by social marketing techniques
(Mah, Deshpande, & Rothschild, 2006).
Understanding the application of elements of social marketing to changes in
both individual health behavior and health
care practices takes some realignment of traditional attitudes toward promoting such
changes. Behavior change requires more than
the conviction of the agency, committee, or
organization that change is needed. Social
marketers seek to understand the needs of
both the individuals and the organizations
they are interested in and to get agreement
from those individuals that change is both
needed and achievable. Therefore, social marketing strategies are fundamentally consumerfocused, voluntary commercial marketing
techniques that take into consideration the
audience’s ability and desire to change and
that are designed to change behavior over time
instead of all at once. One such model is the
stages of change developed by Prochaska and
DiClemente (1983). Parallels to CQI begin
to become apparent from this definition; its
focus is on consumers/customers and the ultimate goal of making gradual behavior changes
(i.e., continuous improvements in health or
social behaviors). Another social marketing

model/tool that is directly applicable and has
similarities to CQI tools is journey mapping.

Journey Mapping
As with CQI methods and tools, the practice
of social marketing is always evolving, incorporating new strategies from other fields of
endeavor related to human behavior. A strategy that can be beneficial to CQI is journey
mapping, borrowed from the field of humancentered design—a design process that enables
designers to develop in-depth understanding
about problems people encounter in doing a
task, then generate creative solutions (Kelley &
Kelley, 2013). A journey map graphically illustrates the steps that people go through to complete an action, such as cleaning a patient’s room,
or to interact with a device, such as a medication pump. The maps focus on “pain points,” or
the barriers people encounter, doing an action.
Then they use a system of brainstorming that
generates creative interventions that can be
rapidly tested and implemented (IDEO, n.d.).
Social marketers use insights from their audience research to create a map. A journey map
for the background scenario (cleaning patient
rooms) described at the beginning of the chapter might look like that in FIGURE 8.1.

Program Evaluation of Social
Marketing Applications to CQI in
Health Care
A key question that must be asked in all CQI
initiatives is “How do we know if a change is
an improvement?” (Langley et al., 2009). A
logical consequence of that question is that
behavior change will not always happen as
quickly or as widely as it should, especially
if there is disagreement about whether the
change being proposed is an improvement.
For example, Atul Gawande (2009) describes
this concept in detail in regard to the introduction of surgical checklists. The concept is also
the subject of a case study that illustrates how a

social marketing approach can explain behaviors related to the use of surgical checklists and
motivate their greater use (Breland, 2012).
Social marketing, like CQI, also relies on
data when formulating the design and goals of
the program and monitoring and evaluation
of the program. In order to ensure greatest
cost efficiency, a practical approach to gathering data is acceptable. For example, formative research for the planning stage of the
initiative can be applied including the use of
secondary data derived from published articles and gray literature as cost-effective supplements to primary data from focus groups,
Internet and in-person surveys, social media
networking, and direct observation. Formative
research in social marketing aligns with the
Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) approach used

223

in CQI and, in particular, the improvement
model described by Langley et al. (2009). As
noted by Berwick (1996), the primary purpose
of collecting and analyzing these data is learning about improvement and using the data to
implement further improvements in a PDSA
cycle—a direct parallel to the purpose and use
of formative research in social marketing.
CQI initiatives could use these additional types of data to understand how the
patients and employees may act as barriers to
or may benefit from their planned program
improvements. In a hypothetical example,
a hospital management team might hope to
improve utilization of current intensive care
unit medication pumps and defer buying
new equipment. The benefits that health care
management would plan to obtain through
CQI might be improved customer satisfaction, for both external “customers” (patients
and their families) and internal “customers”
(employees); more efficient use of resources,
including time and equipment; and greater
compliance with the CQI program. By adding
social marketing methods, such as conducting formative research with the target audience, compliance with CQI implementation
can be increased through better understanding barriers employees face and benefits that
are important to them. For example, formative research could be conducted with a focus
group of the nurses who use equipment, such
as infusion pumps, to administer medications
intravenously. They could provide critical
information on how equipment is used and
why some types of pumps seem to be in high
demand when other equipment remains in the
closet. Analysis of the focus group data might
reveal that some pumps lack automatic drip
rate calculations that introduce the possibility
of error when calculating manually, and that
otherwise acceptable pumps have poor display
visibility, making it hard to see the readings
from a distance in a darkened room. “Benefits”
important to the nurses include the desire to
provide a high standard of care, making their
patients as comfortable as possible and quick

224

access to the equipment. Using these data, an
improvement team can address barriers to use
and tie use of the pumps into the benefits that
motivate the nurses, thereby obtaining better
outcomes from its CQI program.
For health care service provider managers, other scenarios where social marketing
theories and techniques could be used are
numerous—for example, decreasing the rate of
hospital readmissions for patients discharged
with incisions, decreasing the rate of medication noncompliance or multi-drug interactions after hospital discharge, and improving
surgical safety outcomes by implementing a
simple safety checklist.

Creating a Social Marketing
Strategy and Plan for CQI in
Health Care
When applying social marketing methods
to CQI initiatives, the same formal processes
should be followed as in any social marketing
campaign, beginning with a strategic marketing plan. For example, a good overview of the
process is contained in the “Twelve Strategic
Questions” developed by the Academy for
Educational Development, a social marketing
consultancy (Smith & Strand, 2008, p. 16):

What marketing mix will increase

What is the best time and place to
reach members of our audience so
that they are most disposed to receiving the intervention? (aperture)
How often, and from whom,
does the intervention need to be
received if it is to work? (exposure)
How can I integrate a variety of
interventions to act over time in a
coordinated manner to influence
the behavior? (integration)
Do I have the resources to carry out
this strategy, and if not, where can I
find useful partners?

Note that answers to these questions need
to be determined through audience (customer) research, not by the best guesses or the
impressions of the planning team!
Once the basic questions have been considered, a more substantial detailed plan is
required. A social marketing plan generally
follows a specific sequence of steps, where
each step is informed by the results from
the previous step. Lee and Kotler (2016,
pp. 50–60) outline the following (10-step)

Once the plan is implemented, the monitoring and evaluation of data collected during
and after the campaign will be critical and most
often will utilize primary data. This process is
directly parallel to the use of primary data collection in CQI to measure the baseline and track
the impact of improvements over time—such as
in a health care process—using control charts
or other quantitative CQI tools, as described
in Chapter 4. In social marketing settings, data
for this research may be gathered from focus
groups, online and in-person surveys, personal
interviews, website hits and feeds, and blogs.

A Scenario for How to
Apply Social Marketing
to a Health Care CQI
Initiative

Overview
Social marketing has had numerous health
applications, such as those described earlier
to address automobile safety, smoking cessation, and other vital issues, but it is still relatively new in its application to CQI in health
care. To illustrate how it might be applied to
a significant health care issue, prevention of
medical errors, the following hypothetical scenario is presented. This U.S.-based scenario
utilizes a current, real-world, health care CQI
initiative—a surgical safety checklist, designed
and tested by the WHO to improve patient outcomes and customer satisfaction in hospitals
where surgical procedures take place (Haynes
et al., 2009). Checklists have long been a staple
in the CQI toolbox, and are included in the list
of CQI tools presented in Chapter 4, but are
often overlooked due to their simplicity. However, as Gawande (2007) noted in the popular

225

press, if a new drug was found to be as effective
in saving lives as checklists are, there would
be a nationwide marketing campaign urging
doctors to use it. This scenario takes on that
challenge.
There can be many reasons for not adopting changes and innovations in health care, and
social marketing can be an effective approach
not only to understand these reasons but also
to change behavior. Creating a social marketing
campaign for increasing the use of checklists in
the reduction in surgical errors is simple to organize into basic, logical steps of planning, action,
and evaluation, and provides an excellent opportunity to demonstrate how social marketing
methods can be adapted to health care quality
improvement. Following the executive summary
steps presented earlier from Lee and Kotler’s
(2016) social marketing primer, the checklist utilization process is broken down into the 10 basic
steps outlined earlier. Armed with the strategies
just discussed, a CQI initiative using a social
marketing approach can begin to take shape.

Social Marketing Strategy for the
Introduction of a Surgical Safety
Checklist
Step 1: Social Issue, Background,
Purpose, and Focus
The first step in any social marketing initiative is to understand the background and
reasons why the activity being proposed (e.g.,
using a surgical safety checklist), is important and beneficial. The starting point for the
surgical safety checklist is a review of medical error rates. For example, prior to focusing
more attention on the issue of medical errors,
44,000–98,000 deaths attributable to medical errors occurred in hospitals in the United
States (AHRQ, 2000, 2012, 2013). This issue,
which is also addressed in Chapters 9 and
10 of this text, has been one of several targets of CQI initiatives in health care in recent
years. Several other medical publications

226

Chapter 8 A Social Marketing Approach to CQI Initiatives

(Berwick, 2014; Bliss et al., 2012; Gawande,
2009; Gilkey, Earp, & French, 2008; Haynes
et al., 2009; Price & Savitz, 2012; Swift et al.,
2001; Thiels et al., 2015) describe the use
and effectiveness of checklists as an adjunct
to other improvement processes in reducing
adverse outcomes in surgery; use of checklists is also discussed in Chapters 1, 2, and 4
of this text. For example, Bliss and colleagues
at the University of Connecticut reported statistically significant decreases in 30-day morbidity in overall adverse events from 23.6%
(historical data from the American College of
Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database) to 8.2% in cases with
checklist use (Bliss et al., 2012). Although not
due entirely to the use of checklists alone,
improvements in quality and safety during
surgery are facilitated in a formal way using
a series of steps (checks) such as improving
medical team communication through confirmation of specific safety checks and time outs
during surgical procedures (Millat, 2012).
An example of the surgical checklist and
information about implementation and outcomes is found on the WHO website (WHO,
2009). With this background information in
mind, a key question that remains, as with
any health care innovation or CQI initiative, is
how to broaden further its adoption.
In our hypothetical scenario, hospital
leadership has reviewed information on the
implementation of the checklist and decided
to employ a social marketing effort to encourage surgical service providers to adopt this
checklist—or at least a modified version of the
checklist that meets their needs, such as the
Association of Perioperative Registered Nurses
(AORN) Comprehensive Surgical Checklist
(AORN, 2017). Social marketing can address
the need to position the issue, identify the
exchange being asked of affected staff, identify
beliefs that promote or hinder acceptance of
the checklist, identify cost-effective strategies,
and set up specific, measureable goals to evaluate the outcome of the initiative.

Step 2: Conduct a Situation
Analysis (SWOT)
Performing a SWOT analysis (Strengths,
Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) will
identify any internal or external environmental influences on the initiative. Here is a list of
possible issues:
■
■

■

■

Strengths: Everyone on the surgical team
is interested in patient safety.
Weaknesses: The team is composed of various disciplines—surgeons, nurses, technologists, and anesthesiologists or nurse
anesthetists who have different training
backgrounds and outcome goals.
Opportunities: The health care reform
bills passed in 2010 in the United States
have provisions to provide incentives and
penalties for preventable medical errors.
Threats: Other hospitals may not require
the use of a checklist. The surgeon may
decide to take his or her business to these
other hospitals. Other members of the
team may resist changing the status quo.

Step 3: Select Target Audiences
Several target audiences are involved in this
initiative, and they may be in various states of
readiness to change:
■

■

■
■

■

Surgeon (a physician and the most seniorlevel person on the team): Does not see a
need for change
Anesthetist (either a physician or an
advanced practitioner nurse): Is not comfortable with change
Cardiac perfusionist (a surgical specialist):
Is indifferent to change
Circulating nurse (the surgical procedure
manager): Is ready for change, as surgical
errors impact outcomes, but is concerned
with workflow interruptions
Surgical medical equipment technician (the
person responsible for equipment): Is ready
for change but has feelings of powerlessness

A Scenario for How to Apply Social Marketing to a Health Care CQI Initiative

■

■

Scrub nurse (the person responsible for
assisting the surgeon): Thinks about change
but does not want to disrupt the status quo
Hospital administrator (the person responsible for ensuring checklist use): Is ready
for change, as checklist implementation is
his/her responsibility

Based on these characterizations of the
potential target audiences, the most suitable
persons to initiate change on this team are
the circulating nurse and the hospital administrator. For the purposes of this scenario, the
circulating nurse is chosen as the campaign
leader as the person who has the most team
interaction opportunities.

■

Step 4: Set Behavior Objectives
and Target Goals
The objective of the social marketing strategy is to improve the use of the surgical safety
checklist, thus increasing effective implementation of the checklist and ultimately decreasing the number of medical surgical errors and
improving patient outcomes and customer
satisfaction. After conducting some formative
research (personal communications: Robert
S. Smith, MD, and Kenneth R. Courington,
MD [April 2017]) with clinicians who are surgical team members, the choice of the primary
target audience is confirmed to be the circulating nurse. In deciding upon basic goals, it is
critical that goals be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-sensitive.
This requires the choice of several short-term,
intermediate, and long-term goals. In the
following examples, the goals set will be incorporated into the monitoring and evaluation
plan that will create data from the campaign,
providing vital real-time sampling of the initiative, in the same way CQI methods elicit
feedback. The chosen goals are as follows:
■

Short-term goals
•
All team members will be trained on
the checklist within 1 month by the

■

227

quality assurance manager at the regular weekly staff meeting.
•
Each surgical team will complete
a checklist for one surgery per day
for the 10 working days during the
month, beginning on the first of the
month, for a total of 10 different types
of surgeries, each month for 3 months.
•
The circulating nurse will receive additional training on team leadership.
•
The circulating nurse will record the
surgery information and report to
the nurse manager and CQI team on
the success or difficulties encountered at each instance, weekly.
Intermediate goals
•
At the end of 6 months, each surgical team will complete a checklist
on 50% of the surgeries performed
during the month.
•
The circulating nurse will record the
surgery information and report on
the success or difficulties encountered at each instance, twice a month.
Long-term goals
•
At the end of 12 months, each surgical team will complete the checklist
on each of the surgeries they perform.
•
The circulating nurse will lead a discussion of the pros and cons of the
surgical safety checklist.
•
The average mortality rate will
decline by 40%.
•
The average complication rate will
decline by 30%.

Step 5: Identify Target Market
Audience Barriers, Benefits and
Motivators; the Competition;
and Influential Others
Understanding the reasons for current behaviors is one of the key concepts that a social marketing approach can bring to CQI. Often, the
challenge is simply that changing procedures

228

Chapter 8 A Social Marketing Approach to CQI Initiatives

causes a disruption in the comfortable established workflow, as in this example, where
the target audience is the circulating nurse.
Barriers to the desired behavior change may
involve a circulating nurse with a personality
characteristic that makes him or her less disposed to change of any type. Teams may have
worked out their group dynamics already,
and the circulating nurse may be reluctant
to introduce change in the group because it
may cause discord or change the agreed-upon
decision-making chain within the group. Surgical teams work together in close proximity
in a closed environment, and change may be
viewed as causing unnecessary disruption or
delay in a carefully timed and orderly environment. It is important to uncover motivators
for the target audience, such as pride in overseeing surgeries that avoid the embarrassment
and stress of errors, and then give tools that
empower the nurse with methods for improvement that are easy to perform (see Chapter 6
for more details on team processes, including
motivation, empowerment, decision making
and conflict resolution).

Step 6: Develop a Positioning
Statement
After determining how the target audience
perceives the CQI initiative, it may be necessary to reposition the behavior that is wanted.
Positioning refers to how a behavior is viewed
(e.g., “cool,” evidence-based, desirable) compared to competing behaviors. As previously
stated, the surgical safety checklist may be
viewed as an unnecessary intrusion into the
already tightly packed surgical procedure
schedule. The circulating nurse is aware of the
many times that errors have been caught at the
last minute and avoided, but his or her stress
and anxiety in dealing with such instances may
be less intense than the stress of interrupting
the established workflow during each surgery.
The checklist needs to be repositioned from a

burdensome bureaucratic task to a method of
enhanced communication that all team members can benefit from and that will contribute
to increased patient safety, which enhances
everyone’s job satisfaction and decreases stress
from possible situations where errors have to
be caught and averted. (This latter view is consistent with the motivational goals of the Quadruple Aim as described in Chapter 2).

Step 7: Develop a Strategic
Marketing Mix—The Four Ps:
Product, Price, Place, Promotion
This is where the advantages of adding a combination of the commercial marketing techniques of the four P’s—Product, Place, Price,
and Promotion (supplemented by a fifth P,
advocacy for Policy change)—enhance customization of your CQI initiative. The Product (what is being “sold”) is the acceptance
and use of the surgical safety checklist. Tangible activities that support adoption of the
behavior might include training in the use
of the checklist and blog postings from other
clinicians about how they successfully incorporated use of the list. The Place, or location
of the campaign, should be where the behavior is to be performed—in this case, the work
environment (i.e., the surgical suite). “Costs”,
including time costs, are the Price for performing the behavior, such as change in the
established workflow, which should already
be partially determined. Any monetary incentives that might be available for adherence to
the checklist, such as extra time off or a cash
bonus, should also be considered here, as well
as nonmonetary incentives, such as employee
recognition. Other approaches that address
the identified cost might include having the
team discuss how they can best use the checklist to minimize disruptions or hearing from
successful users of the checklist. The Promotion consists of the messages and methods for
communicating to support doing the desired

A Scenario for How to Apply Social Marketing to a Health Care CQI Initiative

behavior. It may be as simple as a large laminated checklist posted in the surgical break
room, daily email reminders sent to the circulating nurse’s computer, or brightly colored
reminder stickers or stars posted at the top of
the surgical schedule clipboard.

Step 8: Develop a Plan for
Monitoring and Evaluation
By identifying goals, the process for creating a plan for monitoring and evaluation has
begun. A simple flowchart of inputs, outputs,
and outcomes will help identify other goals
and establish a system of continuous monitoring of the CQI initiative. The social media
networking field has exploded, and there are
numerous opportunities to use these platforms
(e.g., a Facebook page) and devices (e.g., an
Internet-enabled mobile phone) to gain information about attitudes and beliefs about the
surgical safety checklist. A link could be set up
on the hospital website leading employees to
information about other hospitals’ implementation of the checklist. The circulating nurse
could create a blog that might be shared with
other nurses on a nursing social networking
website. Another link could be created on the
website leading to a survey that records patient
satisfaction data during the implementation
of the checklist period. A sample evaluation
plan is shown in TABLE 8.1. Note that this plan
includes and tracks the goals defined in Step 4.

Step 9: Establish Budgets and
Find Funding Sources
Monetary considerations are often a barrier
when a social marketing approach is proposed, as budgets are so often tight and marketing a quality improvement initiative may
seem unnecessary and expensive. The costliest
parts of the process are often the marketing
research activities, developing tangible products, producing communication materials (and

229

purchasing time, if mass media is used), and
evaluation. However, much of the marketing
research on the target audience may already
be available commercially. Using secondary
resources is often a cost-effective method for
researching the target audience. Internal and
external partners can often assist in developing
materials or conducting evaluations. In addition, this type of campaign is very limited in
scope and is generally quite inexpensive. It is
important to remember that social marketing
is as much a mindset and a way to think about
problems and solutions as it is a series of tasks
or tangible offerings that cost money.

Step 10: Complete an
Implementation Plan
This final step in the plan is the actual blueprint for the campaign. Here is where formative
research, objectives and goals, target audience
decisions, and methods for data monitoring
and evaluation come together. The implementation plan identifies who will do which activities during what timeframe. It also considers
how to sustain your efforts. A unified social
marketing strategy would be focused on a
local target audience, the circulating nurse in
the surgical department. In exchange for disrupting the comfortable established workflow,
the circulating nurse gains the responsibility
for leading the team in an important patient
safety initiative and provides simple, effective
tools for improving surgical safety. The strategy
will be implemented in three distinct phases:
(1) a training phase where the circulating nurse
is named as the safety leader and other team
members acknowledge his or her role; (2) a pilot
run where the surgical checklist is only implemented in a portion of all surgeries and where
the circulating nurse will record information for
data analysis by the CQI team; and (3) a phase
where the entire team comes together with the
circulating nurse as the team leader to give feedback on the initiative to the CQI team. As a final

Conclusions

As with other innovations in health care,
the use of social marketing as a CQI technique is evolving over time because of crossdisciplinary thinking/learning. Similar to the
way that measuring patient feedback grew
out of traditional commercial market research,
social marketing applications have been integrated to address health and other social issues.
Social marketing was built from foundations in
commercial marketing and continues to grow
from advances in practices and concepts in
commercial marketing. There is every reason
to believe that social marketing will continue
to grow as a new technique and set of tools for
helping to further the adoption of innovations
and improvements in health care.

In this brief overview of the social marketing approach as applied to CQI, it is difficult to examine all the possibilities and
uncover all nuances that the fusion of these
two powerful strategies make possible. Using
a scenario based on the use of the surgical
safety checklist, a simple CQI method is given
strength and accountability through proven
social marketing methods to change behavior for the betterment of the common good of
both internal and external customers—a safer
surgical environment not only for patients but
also for the team members performing the
surgery. The use of social marketing in conjunction with CQI represents an important
step in the further evolution of both fields.
It is the hope that this introduction to social
marketing may spark many new ideas and
methods of improvement and implementation
in medical environments that may be encountered by various medical specialties and situations. The use of social marketing applications
not only may improve outcomes of specific
CQI initiatives, but in the longer term may
help to foster greater diffusion of the CQI philosophy and processes throughout the health
care community.

CHAPTER 9

Assessing Risk and
Preventing Harm in the
Clinical Microsystem
Paul Barach and Julie K. Johnson
To err is human, to cover up is unforgivable, and
to fail to learn is inexcusable.
— Sir Liam Donaldson

T

he framework of health care delivery
is shifting rapidly. Capital budgets and
operational efficiency are critical in this
time of shrinking reimbursement, increasing
share of risk, and evolving models of care delivery. Modern medical care is complex, expensive, and at times dangerous. Across the world,
hospital patients are harmed 9.2% of the time,
with death occurring in 7.4% of these events.
Furthermore, it is estimated that 43.5% of these
harm events are preventable (de Vries et al.,
2008; Landrigan et al., 2010). As illustrated
in FIGURE 9.1, medical error is now the thirdleading cause of death, following heart disease
and cancer (Makary & Daniel, 2016). The
rates could be debated, as they depend on the
methods used in the studies as well the levels of
underreporting; however, what is clear is that

we need to change and improve our health care
systems dramatically. Most significantly, the
study of patient safety has identified the need to
design better systems—ones that make sense to
providers and respect their work—to prevent
errors from causing patient harm (Barach &
Phelps, 2013). From all perspectives—patients’
and providers’ as well as the health care
system’s—the current level of avoidable harm is
unacceptable and financially ruinous.
The goal of this chapter is to discuss how
to develop reliability and resilience in health
care systems while embedding a vision of
zero avoidable harm into the culture of health
care. Achieving this vision requires a risk
management strategy that includes: (1) identifying risk—finding out what is going wrong;
(2) analyzing risk—collecting data and using
appropriate methods to understand what it
means; and (3) controlling risk—devising and
implementing strategies to better detect, manage, and prevent the problems that produce
harm (Dickson, 1995).

This chapter begins with the background
and definitions of risk management. We discuss the universal ingredients of individual
accidents, organizational accidents, and human
error. We then discuss models of risk management, focusing on how to address the barriers
to creating an effective culture of safety and
engagement and present strategies for applying
concepts to clinical microsystem settings. The
chapter concludes with a discussion on the role
of disclosure of adverse events as part of a comprehensive risk management strategy.

Risk Management—
Background and
Definitions

Traditionally, risk has been seen as exposure
to events that may threaten or damage the

organization (Walshe, 2001). Essentially, risk
is the chance of something happening that
will have an impact on key elements. It can be
measured in terms of consequences and likelihood. The task of risk management, therefore,
becomes balancing the costs and consequences
of risks against the costs of risk reduction. The
goal in clinical risk management should be to
improve care and protect patients from harm;
however, a perverse incentive for the organization as well as for those who work within
the organization is that risk management may
become a financially driven exercise that is at
odds with the clinical mission of the organization (Vincent, 1997). Clinical risk management is the culture, process, and structures that
are directed toward the effective management
of potential opportunities and adverse events.
We measure risk in terms of the likelihood
and consequences of something going wrong,
which is in contrast to how we measure quality
(i.e., the extent to which a service or product

Risk Management—Background and Definitions

achieves a desired result or outcome). Quality
is commonly measured by whether a product
or service is safe, timely, effective, efficient,
equitable, and patient-centered (IOM, 2001).
There is substantial evidence that the
majority of harm caused by health care is avoidable and the result of systemic problems rather
than poor performance or negligence by individual providers. The past several years have
seen an increase in proposed or operative legislation, including a near-miss reporting system, changes in mandated reporting systems,
and the creation of state agencies dedicated to
the coordination of patient safety research and
implementation of change. There is clear policy guidance and a compelling ethical basis for
the disclosure of adverse events to patients and
their families. Mechanisms have been developed to involve all stakeholders—the government, health care professionals, administrators
and planners, providers, and consumers—in
ongoing, effective consultation, communication, and cultural change. These cultural and
regulatory devices have helped engender more
trust, which is an essential element in developing and sustaining a culture of safety.

2.

Accidents
Research in managing risk has focused on the
culture and structure of the organization. Perrow (1984) advanced the Normal Accidents
Theory, which describes accidents as inevitable in complex, tightly coupled systems such
as chemical plants and nuclear power plants.
These accidents occur irrespective of the skill
and intentions of the designers and operators;
hence, they are normal and difficult to prevent. Perrow further argues that as the system
gets more complex, it becomes opaque to its
users, so that people are less likely to recognize
and fear potential adverse occurrences. There
are three universal ingredients of accidents:
1.

All human beings, regardless of
their skills, abilities, and specialist
training, make fallible decisions and
commit unsafe acts. This human

237

propensity for committing errors
and violating safety procedures can
be moderated by selection, training, well-designed equipment, and
good management, but it can never
be entirely eliminated.
All man-made systems possess latent
failures to some degree. This is true
no matter how well designed, constructed, operated, and maintained
a system may be. These unseen
failures are analogous to resident
pathogens in the human body that
combine with local triggering factors (e.g., life stress, toxic chemicals)
to overcome the immune system
and produce disease. Adverse events
such as cancers and heart attacks
in well-defended systems do not
arise from single causes but from
multifactorial hits that overwhelm
the system’s natural defenses. The
adverse conjunction of such factors,
each necessary but insufficient alone
to breach the defenses, are behind
the majority of adverse events.
All human endeavors involve some
measure of risk. In many cases, the
local hazards are well understood
and can be guarded against by a
variety of technical or procedural
countermeasures. No one, however,
can foresee all the possible adverse
scenarios, so there will always be
defects in this protective armor.

These three ubiquitous accident ingredients reveal something important about the
nature of making care safer (Bernstein, 1996).
We can mitigate the risk of adverse events by
process improvement, standardization, and an
in-depth understanding of the safety degradations in systems, but we cannot prevent all risk.
Embracing this uncertainty and implementing
the training and curriculum to cope with it,
as opposed to focusing solely on minimizing
it, is essential in high-risk, highly coupled
industries.

238

Chapter 9 Assessing Risk and Preventing Harm in the Clinical Microsystem

Outside health care, the most obvious
impetus for the renewed interest in human
error and impact of the organizational
dynamics has been the growing concern over
the terrible costs of human errors that led
to disasters. Examples include the Tenerife
runway collision in 1977 (540 fatalities), the
Three Mile Island nuclear disaster in 1979,
the Bhopal methyl isocyanate tragedy in 1984,
the Challenger space shuttle accident in 1986
(Vaughn, 1996), the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 (Reason, 1997), and the Deepwater
Horizon disaster in 2010 (Ingersoll, Locke, &
Reavis, 2012). There is nothing new about
tragic accidents caused by human error, but
in the past, the injurious consequences were
usually confined to the immediate vicinity
of the disaster. Today, the nature and scale
of highly coupled, potentially hazardous
technologies in society and hospitals means
that human error can have adverse effects
far beyond the confines of the individual
provider and patient settings. For example,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa contamination of
a single damaged bronchoscope potentially
infected dozens of patients (DiazGranados
et al., 2009). In recent years, there has been a
noticeable spirit of glasnost (openness) within
the medical profession concerning the role
played by human error in causing medical
adverse events (Millenson, 1997).

The Organizational Accident
Certain systems have been designed and
redesigned with a wide variety of technical
and procedural safeguards (e.g., operating
rooms), yet they are still subject to accidents
and adverse events (e.g., fire in the operating
room, wrong-patient procedure, drug errors).
These types of accidents and adverse events
have been termed organizational accidents
(Perrow, 1984; Reason, 1997). Organizational
accidents are mishaps that arise not from single errors or isolated component breakdowns,
but from the insidious culture change due to

an accumulation of failures occurring mainly
within the managerial and organizational
spheres. Such latent failures may subsequently
combine with active failures and local triggering factors by errant but well-meaning providers to penetrate or bypass the system defenses.
In his classic study of surgical teams, Forgive
and remember, Bosk (1979) demonstrates
how the underlying culture acts to acculturate newcomers, encourage normalized deviance, and suppress external views for change
while enabling substandard practices to go
unchecked. Systemic flaws set up good people to fail (Vaughn, 1999). People often find
ways of getting around processes that seem to
be unnecessary or that impede the workflow.
This accumulated and excepted acceptance
of cutting corners or making work-arounds
poses a great danger to health care over time.
By deviance, we mean organizational behaviors that deviate from normative standards
or professional expectations (e.g., low handwashing compliance before patient contact,
minimal consultant oversight of hospital care
on weekends, suppressing information about
poor care, and so forth). Once a professional
group normalizes a deviant organizational
practice, it is no longer viewed as an aberrant act that elicits an exceptional response;
instead, it becomes a routine activity that is
commonly anticipated and frequently used
(Weick, 2009). A permissive ethical climate,
an emphasis on financial goals at all costs and
an opportunity to act amorally or immorally,
all can contribute to managerial and clinician decisions to initiate deviance (Barach &
Phelps, 2013).
The etiology of an organizational accident
can be divided into five phases (Perrow, 1984):
1.
2.

Organizational processes giving
rise to latent failures;
Conditions that produce errors
and violations within workplaces
(e.g., operating room, pharmacy,
intensive care unit);

Risk Management—Background and Definitions

3.

4.
5.

The commission of errors and
violations by “sharp end” individuals (the “sharp end” refers to the
personnel or parts of the health
care system in direct contact with
patients. In contrast, the “blunt
end” refers to the many layers of
the health care system that affect
the individuals at the sharp end.
These colloquial terms are more
formally known as “active errors,”
which occur at the point of contact
between a human and some aspect
of a larger system, and “latent
errors,” which are the less apparent
failures of the organization);
The breaching of defenses or
safeguards;
Outcomes that vary from a “free
lesson” to a catastrophe.

Viewed from this perspective, the unsafe
acts of those in direct contact with the patient
are the end result of a long chain of events that
originate higher up in the organization. One
of the basic principles of error management is
that the transitory mental states associated with
error production—momentary inattention,
distraction, preoccupation, forgetting—are the
least-manageable links in the error chain
because they are both unintended and largely
unpredictable (Hollnagel, Woods, & Leveson,
2006). These errors have their cognitive origins
in highly adaptive mental processes (Sagan,
1993). Such states can strike health care providers at any time, leading to slips, forgetfulness,
and inattention. The system must be designed
with in-depth defenses to mitigate the impact
of these momentary lapses in awareness and to
maintain the integrity of patient care.

Human Error and Performance
Limitations
Although there was virtually no research in
the field of safety in medicine and health care

239

delivery until the mid-1980s, in other fields,
such as aviation, road and rail travel, nuclear
power, and chemical processing, safety science and human factor principles have been
applied to understand, prevent, and mitigate
the associated adverse events (e.g., crashes,
spills, and contaminations). The study of
human error and of the organizational culture and climate, as well as intensive crash
investigations, have been well developed for
several decades in these arenas (Rasmussen,
1990; Sagan, 1993). The presumption of the
non-linear and increasing risk in health care,
associated with an apparent rise in the rate of
litigation in the 1980s and attributable to the
media’s amplified attention to the subject, has
brought medical adverse events to the attention of both clinicians and the general public
(Kasperson et al., 1988).
In parallel with these developments,
researchers from several disciplines have
developed increasingly sophisticated methods for analyzing all incidents (Turner &
Pidgeon, 1997). Theories of error and accident causation have evolved and are applicable across many human activities, including
health care (Reason, 1997). These developments have led to a much broader understanding of accident causation, with less
focus on the individual who commits an error
at the “sharp end” of the incident and more
on preexisting organizational and system factors that provide the context in which errors
and patient harm can occur. An important
consequence of this has been the realization
that rigorous and innovative techniques of
accident analysis may reveal deep-rooted,
latent, and unsafe features of organizations.
James Reason’s “Swiss cheese” model captures these relationships very well (Reason,
1990). Understanding and predicting performance in complex settings requires a detailed
understanding of the setting, the regulatory
environment, and the human factors and
organizational culture that shapes and influence this performance.

Chapter 9 Assessing Risk and Preventing Harm in the Clinical Microsystem

Models of Risk
Management

Risk management deals with the fact that
adverse events, however rare, do continue to
occur. Furthermore, risk management as a
concept means that we should never ignore
the possibility or significance of rare, unpredictable events. Using a creative analogy, Nassim Nicholas Taleb (2010) argues that before
Europeans discovered Australia, there was
no reason to believe that swans could be any
color but white. However, when they discovered Australia, they found black swans. Black
swans remind us that things do occur that we
cannot possibly predict. Taleb continues the
analogy to say that his “black swan” is an event
with three properties: (1) the probability is low
based on past knowledge, (2) the impact of
the occurrence is massive, and (3) it is subject
to hindsight bias; that is, people do not see it
coming, but after its occurrence, everyone recognized that it was likely to happen.
In general, risk management models
take into consideration the probability of an
event occurring, which is then multiplied by
the potential impact of the event. FIGURE 9.2
illustrates a simple risk management model

that considers the probability of an event (low,
medium, or high) and the impact of the consequences (limited/minor, moderate, or significant). Assigning an event in one of the cells
is not an exact science, but the matrix offers
a guideline to an appropriate organizational
response to the risk. The individual unit or
organization would need to determine how
to translate each cell into action (e.g., what is
required for “extensive management” of events
with a significant negative impact and high
likelihood of occurring).

Engineering a Culture
of Safety

How do we create an organizational climate
in health care that fosters safety? What are
the ingredients and key values of a safety culture? While national cultures arise largely out
of shared norms and values, an organizational
culture is shaped mainly by shared practices.
And practices can be shaped by the implementation and enforcement of rules. Culture can
be defined as the collection of individual and
group values, attitudes, and practices that guide
the behavior of group members (Helmreich &

Merritt, 2001). Acquiring a safety culture is a
process of organizational learning that recognizes the inevitability of error and proactively
seeks to identify latent threats. Characteristics
of a strong safety culture include (Pronovost
et al., 2003):
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

A commitment of the leadership to
discuss and learn from errors
Communications founded on mutual trust and respect
Shared perceptions of the importance of safety
Encouragement and practice of
teamwork
Incorporation of nonpunitive systems for reporting and analyzing
adverse events

Striving for a safety culture is a process of
collective learning. When the usual reaction
to an adverse incident is to write another procedure and to provide more training, the system will not become more resistant to future
organizational accidents. In fact, these actions
may deflect the blame from the organization
as a whole. There is a long tradition in medicine of examining past practices to understand
how things might have been done differently.
However, morbidity and mortality conferences, grand rounds, and peer reviews share
many of the same shortcomings, such as a
lack of human factors and systems thinking, a
narrow focus on individual performance that
excludes analysis of the contributory team factors and larger social issues, retrospective bias
(a tendency to search for errors as opposed to
the myriad system causes of error induction),
and a lack of multidisciplinary integration
into the organization-wide culture (Cassin &
Barach, 2017).
If clinicians at the sharp end are not
empowered by managerial leadership to be
honest and reflective on their practice, rules
and regulations will have a limited impact
on enabling safer outcomes. Health care

241

administrators need to understand the fundamental dynamics that lead to adverse events.
Employing tools such as root cause analysis
and failure mode and effects analysis can help
clinicians and others better understand how
adverse events occur, but only if done in an
open and safe manner (Dekker, 2004). Collecting and learning from near-misses is essential. Definitions vary somewhat, but we define
a near-miss as any error that had the potential
to cause an adverse outcome but did not result
in patient harm (Barach & Small, 2000). It is
indistinguishable from a full-fledged adverse
event in all but outcome (March, Sproull, &
Tamuz, 2003). Near-misses offer powerful
reminders of system hazards and retard the
process of forgetting to be afraid of adverse
events. A comprehensive effort to record and
analyze near-miss data in health care has, however, lagged behind other industries (e.g., aviation, nuclear power industry) (Small & Barach,
2002). Vital but underappreciated studies suggest that near-misses are quite common. In a
classic study, Heinreich (1941) estimated there
are approximately 100 near-misses for every
adverse event resulting in patient harm.
A focus on learning from near-misses offers
several advantages (Barach & Small, 2000):
1.

2.

3.

4.

Near-misses occur 3–300 times
more often than adverse events,
enabling quantitative analysis.
There are fewer barriers to data
collection, allowing analysis of
interrelations of small failures.
Recovery strategies can be studied to
enhance proactive interventions and
to deemphasize the culture of blame.
Hindsight bias is more effectively
reduced.

If near-misses and adverse events are inevitable, how do we learn from them once they
occur? The next section discusses an approach
for learning from events using a microsystem
framework.

Chapter 9 Assessing Risk and Preventing Harm in the Clinical Microsystem

Applying Risk
Management Concepts
to Improving Quality
and Safety Within the
Clinical Microsystem

The clinical microsystem as a unit of research,
analysis, and practice is an important level at
which to focus patient safety interventions.
A clinical microsystem has been defined as a
small team of providers and staff providing
care for a defined population of patients (Mohr,
2000; Mohr & Batalden, 2002; Mohr, Batalden,
& Barach, 2004). Most patients and caregivers

meet and work at this system level, and it is
here that real changes in patient care can (and
must) be made. Errors and failure occur
within the microsystem, and ultimately it is the
well-functioning microsystem that can prevent
or mitigate errors and failure to avoid causing
patient harm. Safety is a property of the clinical
microsystem that can be achieved only through
a systematic application of a broad array of
process, equipment, organization, supervision,
training, simulation, and teamwork changes.
The scenario included in EXHIBIT 9.1 illustrates
a patient safety event in an academic clinical
microsystem and how the resulting analysis
enables a microsystem to learn from the event.
Throughout the story, as told from the perspective of a senior resident physician in pediatrics,
there are many process and system failures.

EXHIBIT 9.1 Patient Safety Scenario—Interview with a Third-Year Pediatrics Resident
Resident: I had a patient who was very ill. He was 12 years old and was completely healthy up until
3 months ago, and since then has been in our hospital and two other hospitals pretty much the entire
time. He has been in respiratory failure, he’s had mechanical ventilation (including oscillation), he’s
been in renal failure, he’s had a number of ministrokes, and when I came on service he was having
diarrhea—3 to 5 L/day—and we still didn’t know what was going on with him. We thought that an
abdominal CT would be helpful, and it needed to be infused.
He was a very anxious child. Understandably, it’s hard for the nurses, and for me, and for his mother
to deal with. He thought of it as pain, but it was anxiety, and it responded well to anxiolytics.
When I came in that morning, it hadn’t been passed along to nursing that he was supposed to
go to CT that morning. I heard the charge nurse getting the report from the night nurse. I said, “You
know that he is supposed to go for a CT today.” She was already upset because they were very short
staffed. She heard me and then said that she was not only the charge nurse, but also taking care of two
patients, and one had to go to CT. She went off to the main unit to talk to someone. Then she paged
me and said, “If you want this child to have a scan, you have to go with him.” I said, “OK.” Nurses are the
ones who usually go. But it didn’t seem to be beyond my abilities . . . at the time.
So, I took the child for his CT and his mom came with us. We gave him extra ativan on the way
there, because whenever he had a procedure he was extra anxious. When we got there, they weren’t
ready. We had lost our spot from the morning. My patient got more and more anxious and was actually
yelling at the techs, “Hurry up!” We went into the room. He was about 5 or 6 hours late for his study, and
we had given him contrast enterally. The techs were concerned that he didn’t have enough anymore
and wanted to give him more through his G-tube. I said, “That sounds fine.” And they mixed it up and
gave it to me to give through his G-tube. I went to his side and—not registering that it was his central
line—I unhooked his central line, not only taking off the cap but unhooking something, and I pushed
70 cc of the gastrografin in. As soon as I had finished the second syringe I realized I was using the
wrong tube. I said, “Oh no!” Mom was right there and said, “What?” I said, “I put the stuff in the wrong
tube. He looks OK. I’ll be right back, I have to call somebody.”

Applying Risk Management Concepts to Improving Quality and Safety

243

I clamped off his intravenous line and I called my attending and the radiologist. My attending
said that he was on his way down. The radiologist was over by the time I had hung up the phone. My
patient was stable the whole time. We figured out what was in the gastrografin that could potentially
cause harm. We decided to cancel the study. . . . I sent the gastrografin—the extra stuff in the tubes—
for a culture just in case he grew some kind of infection and then we would be able to treat it and
match it with what I had pushed into the line. I filled out an incident report. I called my chiefs and told
them. . . . They said, “It’s OK. He’s fine, right?” I said, “Yes.” They came up later in the evening just to be
supportive. They said, “It’s OK. It’s OK to make a mistake.”
Interviewer: What was your attending’s response?
Resident: The attending that I had called when I made the mistake said, “I’m sorry that you were in
that situation. You shouldn’t have been put in that situation.” Another attending the next day was
telling people, “Well, you know what happened yesterday,” as if it were the only thing going on for
this patient.
I thought it was embarrassing that he was just passing on this little tidbit of information as if
it would explain everything that was going on. As opposed to saying, “Yes, an error was made, it is
something that we are taking into account.” And he told me to pay more attention to the patient. Yes,
I made the mistake, but hands-down, I still—and always did—know that patient better than he did.
I just thought that was mean and not fair. And the only other thing I thought was not good was the
next morning when I was prerounding, some of the nurses were whispering, and I just assumed that
was what they were whispering about. I walked up to them and said, “I’m the one who did it. I made a
mistake. How is he doing?” I tried to answer any questions they had and move on.
Interviewer: How did the nurses respond when you said that you made a mistake?
Resident: The nurse that had sent me down with him told me, “It’s OK, don’t worry about it.” The others
just listened politely and didn’t say anything.
Interviewer: How did the mother respond to you the next day?
Resident: The next day, I felt really bad. I felt very incompetent. I was feeling very awkward being
the leader of this child’s care—because I am still at a loss for his diagnosis. And after the event, when
the grandma found out—she was very angry. I apologized to the mom, and I thought it would be
overdoing it to keep saying, “I am so sorry.” So, the next day, I went into the room and said to the mom,
“You need to have confidence in the person taking care of your son. If my mistake undermines that at
all, you don’t have to have me as your son’s doctor, and I can arrange it so that you can have whoever
you want.” She said, “No. No, it’s fine. We want you as his doctor.” Then we just moved on with the care
plan. That felt good. And that felt appropriate. I couldn’t just walk into the room and act like nothing
had happened. I needed her to give me the power to be their doctor. So, I just went and asked for it.

Many methods are available to explore the
causal system at work (Dekker, 2002; Reason,
1995; Vincent, 2003; Vincent, Taylor-Adams,
& Stanhope, 1998), and they all suggest the
importance of holding the entire causal system
in our analytic frame, not just seeking a “root”
cause. One method that we have found to be
useful for systematically looking at patient
safety events builds on William Haddon’s
(1972) overarching framework on injury epidemiology (Mohr et al., 2003). Haddon, as the

first Director of the National Highway Safety
Bureau (1966–1969), is credited with a paradigm change in the prevention of road traffic
deaths and injuries moving from an “accidental” or “pre-scientific” approach to an etiologic
one. Haddon was interested in the broader
issues of injury and system failures that results
from the transfer of energy in such ways that
inanimate or animate objects are damaged.
The clinical microsystem offers a setting in
which this injury can be studied. According to

244

Chapter 9 Assessing Risk and Preventing Harm in the Clinical Microsystem

Haddon (1970), there are a number of strategies for reducing losses:
■
■
■
■
■

■
■
■
■

■

Prevent the marshaling of the energy.
Reduce the amount of energy marshaled.
Prevent the release of the energy.
Modify the rate or spatial distribution of
release of the energy.
Separate in time and space the energy
being released and the susceptible
structure.
Use a physical barrier to separate the
energy and the susceptible structure.
Modify the contact surface or structure
with which people can come in contact.
Strengthen the structure that might be
damaged by the energy transfer.
When injury does occur, rapidly detect
it and counter its continuation and
extension.
When injury does occur, take all necessary reparative and rehabilitative steps.

All these strategies have a logical sequence
that is related to the three essential phases of
injury control relating to preinjury, injury, and
postinjury.
Haddon developed a 3 × 3 matrix with
factors related to an auto injury (human, vehicle, and environment) heading the columns

and phases of the event (preinjury, injury,
and postinjury) heading the rows. FIGURE 9.3
demonstrates how the Haddon Matrix can be
applied to analyze an auto accident (Haddon,
1972). The use of the matrix focuses the analysis on the interrelationship between the factors and phases. A mix of countermeasures
derived from Haddon’s strategies is necessary
to minimize injury and loss. Furthermore, the
countermeasures can be designed for each
phase—pre-event, event, and postevent—
similar to designing mechanisms to preventing patient harm. This approach confirms
what we know about adverse events in complex health care environments—it takes a
variety of strategies to prevent and/or mitigate patient harm. Understanding injury in
its larger context helps us recognize the basic
nature of “unsafe” systems and the important
work of humans to mitigate the inherent hazards (Dekker, 2002).
We can also use the Haddon Matrix to
guide the analysis of patient safety adverse
events. Adapting this tool from injury epidemiology to patient safety, we have revised the
matrix to include phases labeled pre-event,
event, and postevent instead of preinjury,
injury, and postinjury. The revised factors,

Microsystems and Macrosystems
Health care organizations are composed of
multiple, differentiated, variably autonomous
microsystems. These interdependent small
systems exhibit loose and tight coupling
(Weick & Sutcliffe, 2001). Several assumptions

are made about the relationship between these
microsystems and the macrosystem (Nelson
et al., 2002):
1.
2.

3.

Bigger systems (macrosystems) are
made of smaller systems.
These smaller systems (microsystems) produce quality, safety, and
cost outcomes at the front line
of care.
Ultimately, the outcomes from
macrosystems can be no better
than the microsystems of which
they are formed.

These assumptions suggest that it is necessary to intervene within each microsystem
in the organization if the organization as a
whole wants to improve. A microsystem
cannot function independently from the
other microsystems it regularly works with
or its macrosystem. From the macrosystem
perspective, senior leaders can enable an
overall patient safety focus with clear, visible values, expectations, and recognition of
“deeds well done.” They can set direction
by clearly expecting that each microsystem
will align its mission, vision, and strategies
with the organization’s mission, vision, and

strategies. Senior leadership can offer each
microsystem the flexibility needed to achieve
its mission and ensure the creation of strategies, systems, and methods for achieving
excellence in health care, thereby stimulating innovation and building knowledge and
capabilities. Finally, senior leaders can pay
careful attention to the questions they ask
as they nurture meaningful work and hold
the microsystem’s leadership accountable to
achieve the strategic mission of providing
safer care.
TABLE 9.1 builds on the research of
high-performing microsystems (Mohr, 2000;
Mohr & Batalden, 2002; Mohr, Batalden, &
Barach, 2004) and provides specific actions
that can be further explored to apply patient
safety concepts to understanding the impact
and performance of clinical microsystems. It
also provides linkages to the macrosystem’s
ongoing organization-centered and issuecentered quality efforts, which can either
support or conflict with this approach, as
discussed in greater detail in Chapter 13.
BOX 9.1 provides a set of accountability questions that senior leaders should ask as they
work to improve the safety and quality of the
organization.

Promoting System Resilience
Across and Between the
Microsystems
Microsystems usually coexist with multiple
other microsystems within the organization.
Patients are aware of the gaps and handoffs
between microsystems as they navigate the
health care system, such as when they transfer from inpatient care back into the community. Patients are aware of the challenges of
“synthesizing” knowledge across the various
microsystems they encounter. Models developed by Zimmerman and Hayday (1999) for
understanding and supporting work on the
relationships across microsystems offer insight
into the generative work of interdependence.
Understanding the dynamics of effective
organizational relationships can be helpful
in thinking about how to foster relationships
between microsystems within the same organization and across differing organizations.
These cross-microsystem relationships are
fundamentally related to improving handoffs,
but this inquiry can also provide opportunities
for learning about systemic problems within
the institution and interventions to improve
quality and safety (Groene et al., 2012). An
effective collaborative relationship is based on
the underlying assumption that collaboration
is a more effective approach to achieve a goal

than multiple individual efforts (Toccafondi
et al., 2012).
Weick suggests that leaders today need
to develop groups that are also respectful of
the interactions that hold the group together
(Weick, 1993, 1995). Resilient groups have
respectful interactions that are founded on
three major elements (Weick, 1996):
1.
2.

3.

Trust—a willingness to base beliefs
and actions on the reports of others
Honesty—reporting so that others
may use one’s observations in
developing and enhancing their
own beliefs
Self-respect—integrating one’s perceptions and beliefs with the reports
of others without depreciating them
or oneself

Four aspects of the relationship can
help generate creative responses to the
diagnosed challenges facing entities needing to work better together (Zimmerman &
Hayday, 1999):
1.
2.

3.

The separateness or differences of
the two microsystems
The talking–listening–tuning opportunities that the two microsystems have
The action opportunities that the
two entities have

Role of Risk Management and Patient Disclosure

4.

The reasons they have to work
together

Balanced attention to each of these aspects
enables creative work.
The conditions also must be present for
relationships to develop across organizations
(Kaluzny, 1985). For voluntary interactions—
which may be quite different than those
mandated by an external power—several conditions must be met. There must be an internal
need for resources, a commitment to an external problem, and the opportunity to change. In
addition, there must be a consensus regarding
both the external problem(s) facing the organizations and the specific goals and services
for developing a joint effort. The Institute of
Medicine report To err is human (IOM, 2000)
brought patient safety to the forefront of the
agenda and set the stage for discussing specific
goals and strategies for achieving those goals.
Mitchell and Shortell (2000) provide a synthesis of the literature on the success of community health partnerships that suggests several
factors that influence the success of interorganizational relationships. These factors are:
■
■
■
■
■
■

Context
Strategic intent
Resource base
Membership heterogeneity
Coordination of skills
Response to accountability

Context refers to the environment in
which the partnership exists—the internal and
external stakeholders, their historical relationships and influence, the presence or absence
of human and financial resources, the political
environment, public sentiments, and the current challenges facing the community. Strategic
intent—a similar concept to a consensus on the
external problem(s) facing the organizations—
refers to the reasons the interorganizational
relationship is formed. A diversified resource
base helps ensure that the collaborative is able
to pursue the strategic intent without getting
sidetracked by pursuing the goals of a single
funding agency. Membership heterogeneity

249

refers to the balance of the participating members in regard to the number and types of
participants. Informal as well as formal communication mechanisms ensure that the collaborators meet their own goals and are held
accountable to demonstrate their progress
internally and externally.

Role of Risk
Management and
Patient Disclosure

When patients seek medical care, they entrust
their health to us. Health care providers have a
responsibility or “fiduciary duty” to act in the
best interests of the patient (Kraman & Hamm,
1999). Properly assessing the type of procedure planned (e.g., invasive vs. noninvasive),
patient risk factors, type of drug to use (e.g.,
hypnotic vs. analgesic), and type of team and
level of support are all critical. When assessing
the level of risk of the procedure, we should
ask, What are the desired clinical effects? How
quickly are effects desired? What is the desired
duration of effects? And are there any adverse
“other” clinical effects?
Injured patients and their families want
to know the cause of their bad outcomes,
especially if the adverse event was caused by
an error (Studdert, Mello, & Brenna, 2004).
The most important factor in the decision to
file lawsuits is not negligence but ineffective
communication between patients and providers (Wu et al., 1997). Malpractice suits often
result when an unexpected adverse outcome
is met with no effort to apologize, with a lack
of empathy from physicians and a perceived
or actual withholding of essential information
(Barach, 2005; Wu et al., 1997).
Studies consistently show that health
care providers are understandably reticent
about discussing errors, believing they have
no appropriate assurance of legal protection
(LeBlang & King, 1984). This reticence, in turn,
impedes systemic and programmatic efforts to

250

Chapter 9 Assessing Risk and Preventing Harm in the Clinical Microsystem

prevent medical errors. A growing initiative in
health care has been to encourage open and
frank discussion with patients and their families after an adverse event; this initiative has
met with salutary effects. The lack of evidence
that disclosure adversely impacts claims, case
resolution, and patient and family perceptions
is changing organizational practices.
Evidence from the University of Michigan supports an aggressive disclosure policy
(Clinton & Obama, 2006). In 2002, the University of Michigan Health System launched a
program with three components: (1) acknowledge cases in which a patient was hurt because
of medical error and compensate these patients
quickly and fairly, (2) aggressively defend cases
that the hospital considers to be without merit,
and (3) study all adverse events to determine
how procedures and systems can be improved.
Disclosing an adverse event should occur
when the adverse event (1) has a perceptible
effect on the patient that was not discussed
in advance as a known risk, (2) necessitates
a change in the patient’s care, (3) potentially
poses an important risk to the patient’s future
health, even if that risk is extremely small, and
(4) involves providing a treatment or procedure without the patient’s consent (Cantor
et al., 2005). From an ethical perspective, the
disclosure process should begin at the time of
discussing the consent form and interventions
with the patients (Barach & Cantor, 2007).

▸

Conclusions

The health care system has begun to approach
patient safety in a more systematic way, but
we continue to tolerate an extraordinary level
of risk and preventable harm. There is a clear
need to improve the safety of care, as patients
still suffer harm from medical care at alarmingly high rates. Strong leadership is needed
to change organizational cultures to achieve a
vision of zero tolerance of preventable harm.
The application of safety science and reliability principles, methods, and analytical tools in

the health sector promises the development of
a coherent bundle of interrelated strategies for
change. Reliability principles include methods
of evaluating, calculating, and improving the
overall reliability of a complex system—have
been used effectively in industries such as manufacturing to improve both safety and the rate at
which a system consistently produces appropriate outcomes. Even the most advanced health
care organizations acknowledge that they are on
a journey to achieving high reliability and need
to address four essential building blocks: (1) a
culture devoted to quality; (2) responsibility
and accountability of staff; (3) optimizing and
standardizing processes; and (4) constant measurement of performance.
Much organizational and leadership work
is needed to change the mental model of clinicians and providers toward a system-based
change. The traditional approach within medicine and health care was to emphasize the
individual’s responsibility for errors and to
encourage the belief that the way to eliminate
adverse events was for individual clinicians to
perfect their practices. This simplistic approach
fails to address the important and complex systematic flaws that contribute to the genesis of
adverse events, and also perpetuates a myth of
infallibility that is a disservice to both clinicians
and their patients. The focus on the actions of
individuals as the sole cause of adverse events
inevitably results in continued system failures,
resulting in the injury and death of patients and
the tendency for clinicians to blame themselves
for this harm. The efforts of the innumerable
government bodies around the world to align
external financial, regulatory, and educational
incentives are beginning to have an impact on
clinicians’ and providers’ interest in embracing
the safety themes described in this chapter.
Cultural and process changes require
profound alterations in management thinking, staff empowerment, and communications
skills within and across disciplines. Attributing errors to system failures does not absolve
clinicians of their duty of care or their fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of their

References

251

patients. In fact, acknowledging system failures adds to that duty a responsibility to admit
errors, investigate them collaboratively, and
participate in redesign for a safer system. One
way to achieve this is to deconstruct errors and

failures at the front lines of health care as a way
to assess risk and develop further strategies for
managing risk. Such understanding and corrective efforts can be made to embed quality
and safety into the microsystem.

CHAPTER 10

Classification and the
Reduction of Medical Errors
Donna Woods
Human fallibility is like gravity, weather, and
terrain, just another foreseeable hazard.
— J. T. Reason (1997, p. 25)

T

he publication of the Institute of
Medicine’s report, To err is human,
highlighted that 44,000 to 98,000 deaths
occurred each year from the care patients
receive for a particular condition, rather
than the condition itself (IOM, 2000). In fact,
updated error incidence findings from the
2010 Office of the Inspector General’s Report
on Adverse Events in Hospitalized Medicare
Beneficiaries (Levinson, 2010) now estimate
that 180,000 deaths occur in hospitals per year
in people over 65 years of age. Without even
including the remainder of the population, this
made medical errors the third-leading cause of
death after cardiovascular disease and cancer.
Given this considerable excess mortality
and harm, one of the key foci of the field of
patient safety is to understand the underlying
attributes, vulnerabilities, and causes in the

systems and processes of care leading to errors
and harm. If the mechanisms and causes are
well understood, interventions to address
these can be developed in order to prevent or
mitigate harm.
When errors occur in high-risk environments, such as health care (IOM, 2000), there
is a greater potential for harm. Health care is
very complex, and an effective system of classification should accurately represent this level
of complexity. By understanding human error,
we can plan for likely, and potentially predictable, error scenarios and implement barriers to prevent or mitigate the occurrence of
potential errors. This chapter will discuss the
definitions, theories, and existing systems
of classification that are used improve our
understanding of the mechanisms of errors
and patient safety events in order to apply this
knowledge to reduce harm. Common definitions are essential to a standardized classification system. See TABLE 10.1 for some common
definitions of some important terms in the
field of patient safety.

Chapter 10 Classification and the Reduction of Medical Errors

TABLE 10.1 Terms and Definitions
Terms

Definitions

Error

“Error is defined as the failure of a planned action to be completed as intended
or the use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim.” (IOM, 2000; QuIC, 2000)
Errors can occur in both the planning and execution stages of a task. Plans
can be adequate or inadequate, and actions (behavior) can be intentional or
unintentional. If a plan is adequate, and the intentional action follows that
plan, then the desired outcome will be achieved. If a plan is adequate, but an
unintentional action does not follow the plan, then the desired outcome will not
be achieved. Similarly, if a plan is inadequate, and an intentional action follows
the plan, the desired outcome will again not be achieved (IOM, 2000; QuIC, 2000).
“An act of commission (doing something wrong) or omission (failing to do the
right thing) leading to an undesirable outcome or significant potential for such
an outcome.” This definition highlights the fact that an error while it can lead to
harm does not need to lead to harm to be so assessed (IOM, 2000; QuIC, 2000).

Adverse Event

“An adverse event is defined an injury that was caused by medical management
(rather than the underlying disease) and that prolonged the hospitalization,
produced a disability at the time of discharge, or both.” (Thomas et al., 2000)

Preventable
Adverse Event

A preventable adverse event is defined “as an adverse event that could have been
prevented using currently available knowledge and standards.” (Thomas et al., 2000)

Sentinel Event

A sentinel event is a Patient Safety Event that reaches a patient and results in
any of the following:
■
■
■

Death
Permanent harm
Severe temporary harm and intervention required to sustain life

(TJC, 2017).
Never Events

National Quality Forum described 29 serious events also called Serious
Reportable Events, “which are extremely rare medical errors that should never
happen to a patient.” (AHRQ, 2017b)

Incident

“An unplanned, undesired event that hinders completion of a task and may
cause injury, illness, or property damage or some combination of all three in
varying degrees from minor to catastrophic. Unplanned and undesired do not
mean unable to prevent. Unplanned and undesired also do not mean unable to
prepare for. Crisis planning is how we prepare for serious incidents that occur
that require response for mitigation.” (Ferrante, 2017b)

Near Miss

"A near miss is defined as event that could have had adverse consequences but did
not and was indistinguishable from fully fledged adverse events in all but outcome.
In a near miss, an error was occurred, but the patient did not experience clinical
harm, either through early detection or sheer luck.” (AHRQ, 2017a)

Skill-, Rule-, and Knowledge-Based Classification

▸

Why Classify Safety
Events?

A key component of improving patient safety
is to conduct an assessment of safety incidents
or events that occur, and through these assessments, to gain an understanding of the vulnerabilities that exist in the related systems and
processes. Risk assessment is the science of
risks and their probability (Haimes, 2004). This
commonly involves error or event classification.
A patient safety error/event classification is a
method for standardizing language, definitions,
and conceptual frameworks for optimal discussion, improvement, and dissemination of knowledge on patient safety (IOM, 2004; Woods et al.,
2005). A classification system can be used within
a reporting system or used to analyze events.
Through the classification of events, trends can
be assessed. The use of an effective system of
classification is an important part of risk assessment and helps to group “like” (similar) risks and
safety events as well as to distinguish characteristics in similar but “unlike” events for more effective and nuanced intervention development.
Event classification is a standardized
method by which the event, contributors and
causes of the event, including the root causes,
are grouped into categories (Woods et al., 2005).
Accident classification was initially used in
nuclear power and aviation and has expanded
into use in health care (Barach & Small, 2000).
Additionally, by analyzing many events and
applying the same standardized classification
scheme, patterns can be detected in how these
events develop and occur (Woods et al., 2008).
An understanding of the different error types
is critical for the development of effective error
prevention and mitigation tools and strategies (Vincent, 2006). A variety of these tools
and strategies must be implemented to target
the full range of error types if they are to be
effective. There are several different systems of
classifications of error that describe differing
characteristics of an error. Many of these systems of classification are built on the prevailing

255

theoretical framework of Reason’s Swiss Cheese
Model of accident occurrence (Reason, 2000).

▸

Skill-, Rule-, and
Knowledge-Based
Classification

James Reason posited a classification of human
error (Reason, 1990). Errors result from a variety of influences however, believed the underlying mental processes that lead to error are
consistent, allowing for the development of a
human error typology. The terms skill-, rule-,
and knowledge-based information processing
refer to the degree of conscious control exercised by the individual over his or her activities.
Failures of action, or unintentional actions,
were classified as skill-based errors. This error
type is categorized into slips of action and
lapses of memory. Failures in planning are
referred to as mistakes, which are categorized
as rule-based mistakes and knowledge-based
mistakes (Reason, 1990):
■

■

Skill-based errors—slips and lapses—when
the action made is not what was intended.
Examples of skill-based errors in
daily life and health care include:
•
Daily life—a skilled driver stepping
on the accelerator instead of the brake.
•
Health care—an experienced nurse
administering the wrong medication
by picking up the wrong syringe.
Rule-based mistakes—actions that match
intentions but do not achieve their
intended outcome due to incorrect application of a rule or inadequacy of the plan.
Examples of rule-based mistakes in daily
life and in health care include:
•
Daily life—using woodworker’s glue to
mend a broken plastic eyeglasses frame.
•
Health care—proceeding with extubation before the patient is able to
breathe independently, because of
incorrect application of guidelines.

256

■

Chapter 10 Classification and the Reduction of Medical Errors

Knowledge-based mistakes—actions which
are intended but do not achieve the intended
outcome due to knowledge deficits. Examples of knowledge-based mistakes in daily
life and in health care include:
•
Daily life—a failed cake because a
novice baker mistakenly thought
baking soda could be used in place of
baking powder.
•
Health care—prescribing the wrong
medication because of incorrect
knowledge of the drug of choice.

Slips, Lapses, Mistakes, and
Violations
Reason’s human error typology was further
elaborated to describe slips as attentional failures and lapses as memory failures as depicted
in FIGURE 10.1 (Reason, 1990). Violations
were added as intended actions with further
break-down into common, routine accepted
violations (e.g., work-arounds, short cuts,
potentially risky actions, movement into the
margin of error) and exceptional violations

that are not accepted (i.e., alcohol or drug use
while providing patient care).

Planning and Execution
Error types can be further classified into
whether the error involved taking an action or
inaction. If a needed action is omitted, it is considered an error of omission. For active errors,
there is a further breakdown into whether the
error was the use of a wrong plan—an error of
planning; or whether the plan was good, but
the error was in the execution of the plan—an
error of execution. An example of an error of
planning would be a decision to order a medication that was wrong for a patient’s condition
(e.g., an antiviral medication ordered for a person with a bacterial infection). An example of
an error of execution would be administering
a medication to one patient that was intended
for a different patient.
Furthermore, these elements of error classification can interact with the classification of
slips, lapse, mistakes, and violations described
above and as seen in Figure 10.1.

Skill-, Rule-, and Knowledge-Based Classification

Runciman and colleagues conducted a
review of adverse events in a random selection of admissions in Australia and developed
a classification system called the Quality in
Australia Health Care Study (QAHCS) (Wilson
et al., 1995; Runciman et al., 2009). Risk classification has been an important tool for risk
reduction and safety improvement in high
risk high reliability industries such as nuclear
power, aviation, chemical manufacturing and
others. Valid and reliable classifications of
risk and details of hazards and risks is a very
important tool for exploring risk.
Reason hypothesized that most accidents
can be traced to one or more of four failure
domains: organizational influences, supervision, preconditions, and specific acts. For
example, in aviation, preconditions for unsafe
acts include fatigued air crew or improper
communications practices. Unsafe supervision encompasses for example, pairing inexperienced pilots on a night flight into known
adverse weather. Organizational influences
encompass such things as organizational budget cuts in times of financial austerity.

The Swiss Cheese Model
James Reason (1990) proposed the Swiss Cheese
Model as a theory of accident occurrence, which

has become the dominant paradigm of accident occurrence in health care. Reason’s “Swiss
Cheese” model describes four levels within
which active failures and latent failures may
occur during complex operations.
In the Swiss Cheese Model, an organization’s defenses against failure are modeled
as a series of barriers, represented by slices
of cheese. The holes in the cheese slices represent weaknesses in individual parts of the
system and are continually varying in size
and position across the slices. The system
produces failures when a hole in each slice
momentarily aligns, permitting (in Reason’s
words) “a trajectory of accident opportunity,”
so that a hazard passes through holes in all of
the slices, leading to a failure (Reason, 1990).
The Swiss Cheese model, as Reason conceived
of it, includes both active and latent failures.
Active failures encompass the unsafe acts that
can be directly linked to an accident, such
as human error. This is not about blame for
the action, it is intended to depict the actions
taken most proximal to the event whether a
violation or an error. Latent failures include
contributory factors that may lie dormant for
days, weeks, or months until they contribute
to the accident. Latent failures span the first
three domains of failure in Reason’s (1990)
model (FIGURE 10.2).

Chapter 10 Classification and the Reduction of Medical Errors

Human Factors Analysis and
Classification System (HFACS)
In the early 2000s, Wiegmann and Shappell
were tasked by the U.S. Navy with developing
a classification of risks to reduce the high rate
of error. They developed the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS).
HFACS was designed as a broad human error
framework heavily based on Reason’s Swiss
Cheese Model and was used initially by the
U.S. Navy to identify active and latent failures
that combine to result in an accident with the
goal of understanding the causal factors that
led to the accident (Weigmann & Shappell,
2000, 2003).
The HFACS framework describes human
error at each of four levels of failure (FIGURE 10.3):
1.
2.
3.
4.

Unsafe acts of operators (e.g.,
aircrew)
Preconditions for unsafe acts
Unsafe supervision
Organizational influences

Within each HFACS level, causal categories were developed that identify the active and
latent failures that occur. In theory, at least one
failure will occur at each level leading to an
adverse event. If one of the failures is corrected
at any time leading up to the adverse event,
it is thought that the adverse event would be
prevented.
As can be seen in Figure 10.3, the HFACS
classification further defines an incident in
relation to Reason’s categories of Errors and
Violations, with skill-based errors, decision
errors, and perceptual errors under the Errors
classification and routine violations and exceptional violations under the Violations classification. Likewise, further defining each of
the four primary classifications. Using the
HFACS framework for accident investigation,
organizations are able to identify the breakdowns within the entire system that allowed
an accident to occur and provide insight for
the development of potential interventions for
improvement.

While the HFACS classification system
was developed by the U.S. Navy, the HFACS
framework has been used to assess root causes
within the military, commercial, and general aviation sectors to systematically examine underlying human causal factors and to
improve aviation accident investigations as
well as in many other high-risk industries
such as rail, construction, and mining and
has demonstrated acceptable to high reliability. Studies have shown that the results from
the HFACS classification system are reliable
in capturing the nature of, and relationships
among, latent conditions and active failures.
The kappa statistic is reported in these studies to assess agreement (kappa is a standard
statistical measure of inter-rater agreement
that ranges from 0.00–1.00). In one study, a
post-hoc analysis was conducted on a sample
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
serious incident reports and achieved an interrater reliability kappa of 0.85. In another study
in the biopharmaceutical industry, three pairs
of coders used the HFACS classification system
to code a sample of 161 reports of “upstream”
incidents, “downstream” incidents, and incidents in “operational services.” In this study,
they achieved an overall agreement of 96.66
with a 0.66 kappa, suggesting that this classification system has reasonable reliability for use
(Cintron, 2015).

The Joint Commission Patient
Safety Event Taxonomy
Improvement in patient safety involves risk
assessment to understand the attributes of
a safety incident. The Joint Commission
(TJC) encouraged hospitals to conduct risk
assessments on events that occurred in hospitals, particularly serious adverse events or
“sentinel events” to reduce harm. To support
and facilitate the conduct of hospital safety
risk assessments, in 2005 TJC developed the
Patient Safety Event Taxonomy to put forward
a standardized terminology and classification

schema for near miss and adverse events to
develop a common language and definitions
(Chang et al., 2005). This taxonomy was developed through application of the results from
a systematic literature review, evaluation of
existing patient safety terminologies and classifications, assessment of the taxonomy’s face
and content validity, patient safety expert

review and comment, and assessment of the
taxonomy’s comparative reliability. Five root
nodes were proposed based on the review of
other classification schemes. The root nodes
include: impact, type, domain, cause, and prevention and mitigation (Chang et al., 2005).
The taxonomy was applied qualitatively to reports submitted to TJC’s Sentinel

260

Chapter 10 Classification and the Reduction of Medical Errors

Event Program. According to the developers,
the taxonomy incorporated works by Reason
(1990), Rasmussen (1986), Runciman (1998,
2002), and Hale (1997) as well as contributions from aviation and other high-risk/highreliability industries. Root nodes were divided
into 21 subclassifications, which were then
subdivided into more than 200 coded categories and an indefinite number of noncoded
text fields to capture narrative information
about specific incidents.

World Health Organization
International Classification for
Patient Safety (ICPS)
The Patient Safety Event Taxonomy was disseminated internationally through TJC International and then in response to the growth
in the recognition of the magnitude of excess
morbidity and mortality from patient safety,
the World Health Organization (WHO)
launched the World Alliance for Patient Safety
to “‘pay the closest possible attention to the
problem of patient safety and to establish and
strengthen science-based systems necessary
for improving patients’ safety and quality of
care” (WHO, 2002). Concurrent with the
development of TJC (then JACHO) Patient
Safety Event Taxonomy, since 2005, WHO was
tasked with developing global norms and standards to support and inform the development
of effective patient policies and practices.
Runciman et al. (2009) drafted the International Classification for Patient Safety (ICPS),
drawing on many sources and terms including TJC Patient Safety Taxonomy. The accumulated terms were analyzed and assessed
through responses to a Delphi process, with
the focus on patient safety classification
(Thomson, 2009). The conceptual framework
for the ICPS, consisting of 10 high level classes

According to the conceptual framework
for the ICPS, “A patient safety incident in this
context is an event or circumstance that could
have resulted, or did result, in unnecessary
harm to a patient. A patient safety incident can
be a near miss, a no harm incident or a harmful incident (adverse event). The class, incident
type, is a descriptive term for a category made
up of incidents of a common nature grouped
because of shared, agreed features, such as
“clinical process/procedure” or “medication/
IV fluid” incident. Although each concept is
clearly defined and distinct from other concepts, a patient safety incident can be classified as more than one incident type. A patient
outcome is the impact upon a patient, which is
wholly or partially attributable to an incident.
Patient outcomes can be classified according
to the type of harm, the degree of harm and
any social and/or economic impact. Together,
the classes incident type and patient outcomes
are intended to group patient safety incidents
into clinically meaningful categories” (The
World Alliance for Patient Safety Drafting
Group, 2009).
In an NIH-funded research study, the
author of this chapter tried to classify the
Incident Types and the Contributing Factors
through application of the WHO ICPS for
clinician described incidents that occurred
during the course of surgical care, which
included operating room set-up, the surgery
itself, and anesthesia management. We developed a web-based confidential Debriefing
Tool, which would proactively collect issues,
challenges, problems, incidents, near misses,
and preventable adverse events from everyone
involved in specific surgeries. The web-based

procedure immediately following the procedure with 2 reminders within 3 days if
needed. Both open-ended questions and specific prompts are used. We sought to develop

a method which would overcome many of the
barriers to incident reporting in a surgical context, including developing a method that would
be perceived as safe for all involved, to report
anything that occurred, large or small, without

fear of personal reprisal or reprisals for others
on the team. The web-based Debriefing Tool
was deployed across four large transplant centers. See examples of reported incidents and
the application, function, and results of the use
of the WHO ICPS system of classification to
classify emblematic incidents reported from
the surgical care teams below.
Unlike the HFACS which can model the
complexity of multiple causal inputs to an accident, as represented by the Swiss Cheese Model
of accident causation, the WHO ICPS is represented as a linear hierarchical system of classification that requires reviewers to select one
sole Incident Type and one sole Contributing
Factor. Within the Incident Type classification,

there are 13 primary Incident Type classifications. However, the requirement to select only
one classification created forced choices. For
example, for an incident in which the consent
was not available, the primary Incident Type
classification could be either or both Clinical
Administration and/or Documentation, where
both could actually be true error types related
to this incident. Furthermore, each Primary
Incident Type has different downstream classification options which could stunt resulting
understanding of the event. Selecting one or
the other will lead the classification down very
different paths where the secondary classification would be very different. See TABLE 10.2 for
a representation of this challenge.

For example, for Documentation, the secondary classification choices would be, Document Involved—Forms/Certificates, and the
Problem classification could be Document

as compared with Clinical Administration
where the secondary classification of the
Process would be Consent and the Problem
could be either Not Performed When Indicated and/or Incomplete/Inadequate. When
a classification system allows only exclusive

the classification results of the incident will
be lost and as well the results will likely lack
strong reliability and accuracy which can
confuse the development of interventions to
improve care and can lead to loss of important
information. Likewise, the primary incident
type for ABO Incompatibility can be classified as Documentation, Clinical Administration, or Blood Products; Incorrect counts
or a lost needle can be classified as a Clinical Process/Procedure or as Medical/Device,
Equipment/Property. In our study, we developed a more specific set of definitions that
created a forced choice selection of one of the

264

Chapter 10 Classification and the Reduction of Medical Errors

classification pathways for similar events, but
this was somewhat arbitrary, lacked precision
and lost potentially important information
about the incident. The linear nature of the
classification patterns limited the classification of incidents, as it did not accurately
reflect the reality of the emergence of the
incidents (McElroy, 2016; Khorzad, 2015;
Ross, 2011)
Similarly, in the classification of contributing factors and hazards, an incident reviewer
must choose between the included factors,
even though frequently many of the listed
factors can contribute to the occurrence of an
incident (McElroy, 2016; Khorzad, 2015; Ross,
2011). The listed primary classifications for
contributing factors in the ICPS are:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Staff Factors
Patient Factors
Work Environment Factors
Organizational Service Factors
External Factors
Other

Assigning a single contributing factor in
many cases oversimplifies the classification
of an incident and is not an accurate representation of the complexity of the interacting
components of these types of events. In many
safety incidents, patient factors are interacting
with staff factors in the context of work environment factors, and organizational factors.
There can be plural factors related to each
component. The requirement in the ICPS to
select one Contributing Factor also sets up a
false choice for the individual conducting the
classification, reliability is compromising reliability, and introducing subjective bias to the
process of classification.

Systems Engineering Initiative
for Patient Safety (SEIPS)
Vincent, a leading thought leader in the field
of human error and safety, described seven
elements that influence safety (Vincent, TaylorAdams, & Stanhope, 1998; Vincent, 2006):

2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

Organization and management
factors
Work environment factors
Team factors
Task factors
Individual factors
Patient characteristics
External environment factors

Building upon Vincent’s model of human
error and safety related elements, Carayon
and colleagues proposed a Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS)
model for human error and design in health
care (Carayon et al., 2006, 2014; Carayon &
Wood, 2010). In the SEIPS classification
model, components of the system are helpfully depicted with intersecting arrows that
illustrate how these components in the system
can interact with one another, representing
the emergent properties of simultaneously
interacting risks depicted through the Swiss
Cheese Model. In the SEIPS 2.0 Framework,
shown in FIGURE 10.5, accidents arise from the
interaction among humans, machines, and
the environment in the sociotechnical system.
Similar to Vincent’s seven elements that influence safety, in the SEIPS Model 2.0 (Holden,
2013) the five interacting elements within the
work system include:
■
■
■
■
■

People—patient and clinical professionals
Tasks
Technology and tools
The organization
External environment

This framework is able to represent the
dynamic work system and work system risks
to effectively model the complexity of medical work. This framework and depiction
facilitates the ability to understand the characteristics and specific patterns of the simultaneous interactions of activities and systems
leading to risk and an incident. This depiction
enables the representation of both safety and
risk as dynamic, not static, and represents
an incident as having not just one input but

multiple inputs to creates a pattern, a perfect
storm, that is frequently hard to foresee prospectively. This form of classification is then
represented as patterns of interactions of the
components in the system and can then provide a fuller, more complete characterization
of the incident. Johnson, Haskell, and Barach
(2016) portray actual patient safety cases to
provide an exercise using this framework for
readers to conduct an analysis of the Lewis
Blackwell case.
Carayon and colleagues (2006, 2014)
apply this kind of incident classification and
analyses and portrayed this in what they call
the configural work systems concepts and
configural diagrams, which provide a more
nuanced and more accurate representation of
the incident. This method for incident analysis and classification enables modeling of both

proximal factors (sharp end) as well as latent
factors (blunt end) and can provide insights
regarding how they interact as well as the specific impact.
By using the configural work system
diagram for incident analysis, it is possible to investigate the types of incidents that
occurred when a particular work system factor (e.g., excessive workload) or combination
of factors (e.g., workload and worker fatigue)
were an active part of the configuration. The
diagram can also be used to analyze and compare how two or more units or organizations
have configured their work system, by design
or otherwise, for the same process or processes. Ideal types of configurations could be
identified for improved safety and resilience
and safety planning. For example, as Holden
(2013) notes, “If we introduce technology A

266

Chapter 10 Classification and the Reduction of Medical Errors

versus technology B, which new interactions
will become relevant between each of those
technologies and the work system’s people,
task, other tool and technology, organization,
internal environment and external environment factors?”

Using Error Classification
for Mitigation and Safety
Improvement
High Reliability Organizations
A high reliability organization (HRO) is an
organization that has succeeded in avoiding
catastrophes in an environment where normal
accidents can be expected due to risk factors
and complexity. In studying these organizations, Weick and Sutcliffe (2015) found several
common features across these industries that
they called HRO principles:
■
■
■
■
■

Preoccupation with Failure
Reluctance to simplify
Sensitivity to operations
Commitment to resilience
Deference to expertise

These principles are very important to
safety risk reduction and mitigation and apply
well to the task of error classification. HROs
do not ignore failures no matter how small
as well as how things could fail. Error reporting systems are designed to collect this type
of information (adverse events, preventable
adverse events, near-misses, etc.) for classification and analysis. In the analysis of these
events, it is important not to overly simplify
what has occurred and to represent the complexity of interactions within the system that
lead to an event not only from the perspective of the clinician but also the perspective
of the patients and their families (Travaglia &
Robertson, 2013). In the recommendation to
be sensitive to operations is the encouragement to understand real processes and their
inputs as they actually occur as opposed to

relying on an idealized process or operation
that may not include various work-arounds.
This is also important for error classification
and risk mitigation. Through a commitment
to resilience there is also attention to the
potential of unintended consequences even
while applying interventions to improve care
based on an analysis of events. Deference to
expertise rather than authority in the context of classification means that the person
with the most information about an incident
or a process to provide relevant contextual
knowledge.
In order to effectively improve the safety
of processes in health care and reduce harm, it
is necessary to accurately represent the complexity of the incident, various contributors
and contextual circumstances. HRO Principles
are very helpful for this. Establishing a culture
of safety with these principles will increase the
number of events reported and the use of these
events to inform safety improvement (Sollecito &
Johnson, 2013).
The SEIPS framework is effective at representing the appropriate complexity, contributors, and inputs in the occurrence of an
incident or event such that an intervention can
address the actual problems. There have been
numerous studies in which the SEIPS framework was used to improve health care design
and safety, for example, a study of the timeliness of follow-up of abnormal test results in
outpatient settings (Singh et al., 2009); a study
on the safety of the Electronic Health Record
(EHR) technology (Sittig & Singh, 2009); a
study improving electronic communication
and alerts (Hysong et al., 2009); characterizing patient safety hazards in cardia surgery
(Gurses et al., 2012); and a study to improve
patient safety for radiotherapy (Rivera &
Karsh, 2008). The SEIPS framework has been
used effectively to examine patient safety in
multiple care settings (Intensive Care Units,
pediatrics, primary care, outpatient surgery,
cardiac surgery, and transitions of care). Many
studies that applied the SEIPS framework
not only to demonstrate its effectiveness for

References

understanding error and incident causation
but also for how to apply this learning to safety
improvement and safety planning.

Conclusions

Safety events are very frequent in health care.
In this chapter, several systems of classification
in use have been described. Some are descriptive and others a based on the psychology of
error, and the strengths and weakness of each
have been presented. When the nature of the
system of classification can represent the varying patterns of incident occurrence, it can be
used as an important and effective tool for risk
reduction and safety improvement. These are
frameworks of event classification that can
be used in Incident Reporting Systems and
to provide a framework for analysis of incidents capture trends and inform quality and
safety improvement. The value of event classification has been demonstrated by numerous other high risk, high reliability industries
as well as in health care, that systems of error

and risk classification are important to understanding patient safety risks in health care
to improve safety (Weigmann & Shappell,
2003; Carayon et al., 2014; Busse & Johnson,
1999). We further understand that High Reliability Organizations apply the practice of
“Reluctance to Simplify Operations” (Weick
& Sutcliffe, 2007). However, if the system for
classification does not accurately describe the
nature and patterns of medical work and the
resulting specific risks or over simplifies
the understanding of the interactions of elements of medical work or risks in the work
system, important information will be lost
and attempts at using the resulting information for safety improvement will be flawed.
In this review of systems of error and incident classification, the HFACS and the SEIPS
frameworks, both of which rely heavily on the
theoretical underpinnings of Reason’s work,
have effectively enabled classification systems
that model the complexity of health care and
error occurrence and have demonstrated their
use for effective risk identification and safety
improvement in health care.

nternational health statistics demonstrate that the United States trails
other developed nations in many public health indicators. A recent survey of 11
high-income nations found that the United
States is an outlier among surveyed countries in regard to ensuring access to health
care, revealing that roughly one-third (33%)
of American adults went without recommended care, declined to see a doctor when

270

they were sick, or did not fill a prescription
due to cost (Osborn et al., 2016). Regarding both infant and maternal mortality,
the United States has continuously ranked
poorly in past decades when compared to
other developed nations (United Health
Foundation, 2016). This trend has endured
in recent years, with the United States ranking 26th in infant deaths among 29 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) nations, with 6.1
deaths per 1,000 live births (compared to
2.3 deaths per 1,000 live births in the topranked nation, Finland) (MacDorman et al.,
2014). Furthermore, although the United
States is by far the highest among 39 OECD
nations in health expenditures, the country

Clarifying Key Terms

ranks near the bottom in life expectancy
at birth—landing at 26th for men and 29th
for women (Organisation for Economic
Co-Operation and Development, 2014). With
rankings such as these, it is evident that we
need to improve public health services and
outcomes in the United States.
Over the past three decades, U.S. public health organizations have increasingly
undertaken a variety of efforts to ensure
and improve the quality of their services.
In recent years, accreditation has become
part of a national focus to advance the quality and performance of public health. At
the same time, public health agencies have
been implementing quality improvement
using proven methods, such as the Model
for Improvement, Lean, and Plan, Do, Study,
Act (PDSA) cycles described throughout this
text and elsewhere (Deming, 2000; Langley
et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2012). Efforts such
as these indicate that public health is moving
beyond a series of projects and tools toward
adopting continuous quality improvement
(CQI) as a means of achieving a public
health system that is effective, efficient, and
in step with other industrialized nations
around the world.

Objectives
In this chapter, we provide an overview of
the adoption and institutionalization of CQI
in U.S. public health organizations. We begin
by providing a brief history of CQI in public health. We then describe current efforts
to promote CQI and explore the opportunities, challenges and progress of public health
organizations in the adoption and institutionalization of CQI, including the important role of accreditation. Finally, we conclude
with a practical example/case study of how
a public health agency has applied quality
improvement methods and tools and their
steps toward institutionalizing CQI.

Clarifying Key Terms

In public health, quality has been defined as
“the degree to which policies, programs, services, and research for the population increase
the desired health outcomes and conditions
in which the population can be healthy” (U.S.
DHHS, 2008, p. 2). Quality assurance is the systematic monitoring and evaluation of the performance of an organization or its programs
to ensure that standards (usually set by public
health experts) of quality are being met. Quality improvement involves using formal methods and tools in designing and redesigning
systems to meet customers’ needs by testing
and implementing ideas from evidence-based
strategies, front-line staff, and customers. In
public health, quality improvement has been
described as a “distinct management process
and set of tools and techniques that are coordinated to ensure that departments [local public
health agencies] consistently meet their communities’ health needs and strive to improve
the health status of their populations” (Riley
et al., 2010, p. 5).
Continuous quality improvement (CQI)
in public health organizations is a structured
organizational infrastructure and culture for
involving staff in planning and executing a
continuous flow of improvements to provide
quality that meets or exceeds the expectations of communities. It focuses on systems
change and generally includes these characteristics: a link to the organization’s strategic
plan, a quality council made up of the organization’s top leadership, quality improvement
training programs for staff, a mechanism for
prioritizing quality improvement projects
and launching quality improvement teams,
and staff support and motivation for quality
improvement activities. An organization that
is committed to CQI may have both quality
improvement and quality assurance processes, but the predominant focus is on quality improvement.

Chapter 11 Continuous Quality Improvement in U.S. Public Health Organizations

History of Actions to
Promote CQI in Public
Health

In 1988, an Institute of Medicine (IOM) report,
The future of public health, declared that the
United States “has lost sight of its public health
goals and has allowed the system of public
health to fall into disarray” (p. 1). Following
the 1988 IOM report, public health experts
and analysts promoted a variety of methods and frameworks for changing the public
health system and improving performance.
By the mid-1990s, the IOM, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the
American Public Health Association, and
the National Association of County and City
Health Officials (NACCHO) adopted the 10
essential public health services framework that
describes the key public health activities that
all communities should address.
Using that framework, the National Public
Health Performance Standards Program developed three assessment instruments to help state
and local public health agencies identify gaps
in achieving optimal performance and inform
quality improvement efforts (CDC, 2015).
During this time of standards development, the Turning Point initiative, jointly
funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) and the W. K. Kellogg Foundation and directed by NACCHO, sought
to transform U.S. public health systems into
more community-based and collaborative
organizations working to prevent disease and
injury, protect the public from threats to their
health, and promote healthy behaviors (Turning Point, 2006). Turning Point emphasized the
use of performance standards in conjunction
with measurement and reporting as well as the
institution of quality improvement methods to
manage change and achieve quality.
Over time, public health organizations
became increasingly interested in standardizing and ensuring quality public health services,

which led to a focus on national public health
accreditation (Stone & Davis, 2012).
In late 2004, the RWJF established the
Exploring Accreditation Steering Committee
to develop recommendations for implementing a voluntary national accreditation program, and, in 2005, launched the Multi-State
Learning Collaborative (MLC) to explore the
feasibility of voluntary national public health
agency accreditation and collect data on existing accreditation practices (Beitsch et al.,
2006; Russo, 2007). In the first phase of the
MLC, five states with mature accreditation or
assessment programs received 1-year grants
to enhance their existing performance assessment and share information with the Steering
Committee and one another. Following that
phase, the Steering Committee recommended
a national model for accreditation, which was
subsequently endorsed by NACCHO and the
Association of State and Territorial Health
Organizations (ASTHO), among others.
In 2007, the second phase of the MLC
began and 10 states received 1-year grants to
focus on quality improvement in the context
of accreditation and assessment. The states
explored ways to improve their own accreditation and assessment programs, shared
their tools and resources, conducted training in quality improvement, initiated quality improvement practices, and informed the
planning for the national public health accreditation program (Gillen et al., 2010).
The third phase began in 2008, when
16 states received 3-year grants to prepare
for national voluntary accreditation, support the Public Health Accreditation Board
(PHAB) in the development of the national
voluntary accreditation program, and bolster use of quality improvement methods in
local and state health departments through
mini-collaboratives in each state (Joly et al.,
2010). The mini-collaboratives—teams of
local and state health department representatives and other partners—implemented quality
improvement projects targeting public health
processes (e.g., developing a community health

Factors Affecting the Ongoing Adoption and Institutionalization of CQI in Public Health

profile) and outcomes in specific topic areas
(e.g., tobacco, immunizations) (Gillen et al.,
2010; Joly et al., 2010).
Also in 2008, the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services (U.S. DHHS)
released the Consensus Statement on Quality in the Public Health System, which, for the
first time, framed a clear, uniform definition
of quality for the public health system: “the
degree to which policies, programs, services,
and research for the population increase the
desired health outcomes and conditions in
which the population can be healthy” (p. 2).
The Consensus Statement also identified
nine quality aims for the public health system: population-centered, equitable, proactive,
health promoting, risk reducing, vigilant, transparent, effective, and efficient (Honoré et al.,
2011; U.S. DHHS, 2008).
Providing a national quality framework
through the Consensus Statement was deemed
necessary to facilitate consistent implementation of quality improvement in the daily routines
of public health practitioners and their organizations. Another purpose of the Consensus
Statement was to demonstrate a national commitment to quality improvement application
throughout all parts of the public health system,
including finance, programs, management, governance, and education (Honoré, 2009; Honoré
et al., 2011). After the release of the Consensus
Statement, U.S. DHHS charged the IOM with
developing quality measures for the 12 leading
health indicator priorities and 26 leading health
indicators in Healthy People 2020 (IOM, 2013).
The report provides suggestions for how government, communities, funders, hospitals, and
other health care organizations could use the
quality measures to guide decisions related to
population health.
In 2010, the CDC Office for State, Tribal,
Local and Territorial Support began what
became a 4-year National Public Health
Improvement Initiative (NPHII) to support
health departments to address performance
improvement, accelerating public health
accreditation readiness activities, and sharing

273

practice-based evidence. The initiative supported 73 state, tribal, local, and territorial
public health organizations via the Prevention and Public Health Fund of the Affordable
Care Act. By the end of the second year of the
program, “[a]pproximately 26% of awardees
had completed an organizational PHAB selfassessment, 72% had established at least 1 of
the 4 components of a performance management system, and 90% had conducted QI activities focused on increasing efficiencies and/or
effectiveness” (McLees et al., 2014, p. 29).

Factors Affecting the
Ongoing Adoption and
Institutionalization of
CQI in Public Health

Accreditation Programs
Accreditation programs at the state and
national level have served as major drivers of
the promotion and adoption of CQI among
state and local public health departments. State
accreditation programs were instrumental in
guiding the development of a national accreditation program, in addition to helping drive
CQI in health departments. North Carolina has
been one of the leaders at the state level. Indeed,
North Carolina was the first state to pilot a state
accreditation program as well as the first to
mandate accreditation for all of its local health
departments (Reed et al., 2009). All 84 North
Carolina local health departments have gone
through initial accreditation and have also been
re-accredited as of July, 2018 (A. Thomas, personal communication, July 12, 2018).
The North Carolina program has clearly
demonstrated the potential to drive CQI in
health departments. A case study by Stone and
Davis (2012) illustrates the link between CQI
and public health accreditation in local public health agencies in North Carolina. Today,
there are three ongoing state accreditation

274

Chapter 11 Continuous Quality Improvement in U.S. Public Health Organizations

programs in North Carolina, Michigan, and
Missouri. Michigan’s statewide program has
many similarities to North Carolina’s, and
Missouri’s program is currently being updated
and revised (D. Stone, personal communication, March 4, 2017).
Building on the early accreditation experience in states, the PHAB was established in
2007 to manage and promote a national voluntary accreditation program for state, local, territorial, and tribal public health departments
(PHAB, 2013). The PHAB program has been
very successful in engaging health departments across the United States. As of March
2017, PHAB has accredited 179 state, local,
and tribal health departments (23, 155, and 1,
respectively), and there are an additional 158
health departments currently in the PHAB
accreditation process pipeline (PHAB, 2017).
Accreditation, whether in public health, in
other areas of health care, or in related industries, has traditionally been primarily a quality
assurance strategy focused on meeting standards set by external experts. In some industries, such efforts have not been particularly
successful or popular; of note, they are often
unpopular with workers because of the focus
on human error, rather than systems, as the
source of most problems. However, Bender
and Halverson (2010) describe the approach to
PHAB accreditation as follows: “Unlike some
health-related agencies and services that are
accredited or otherwise regulated, the PHAB
board of directors has set the public health
accreditation work solidly on the cornerstone
of CQI. In other words, accreditation is a means
to an end, not an end unto itself ” (p. 80).
Due to PHAB’s rapidly expanding reach,
and its focus on CQI, PHAB accreditation has
been a major driver of adoption of CQI in all
public health settings. Further, PHAB requirements also foster institutionalization of CQI,
especially its annual report process for accredited health departments, wherein the accredited health department is required to report
on the elements of CQI that it has implemented, and plans to implement in the coming

year. Indeed, recent evaluation data from the
PHAB program reveals that 92% of PHAB
participants agree or strongly agree that the
PHAB accreditation process led to a “strong
QI culture.” Further, focus groups revealed
that PHAB accreditation changed CQI use in
their health department from periodic to more
institutionalized (Kronstadt et al., 2016).
For a further discussion of the role of
accreditation in health care quality, on a local
and global scale, readers are referred to Chapter 12 of this text.

Governmental and Nonprofit
Organizations
Numerous governmental and nonprofit organizations are providing substantial leadership
in promotion of CQI in the U.S. public health
system. These well-respected organizations
have the visibility and influence to advance CQI
in public health and have been doing so over
the past decade. We have already mentioned
some of the most influential: ASTHO, NACCHO, CDC, U.S. DHHS, PHAB, and RWJF.
Other influential groups that provide technical
assistance, training, and visibility/promotion
include the National Network of Public Health
Institutes (NNPHI), the Public Health Foundation (PHF), and Population Health Improvement Partners, an organization that helps
health-focused organizations and coalitions
build organizational and community capacity to improve and sustain population health.
Population Health Improvement Partners has
provided local and national organizations with
continuous improvement expertise and support
since 2009 (Population Health Improvement
Partners, 2017). TABLE 11.1 lists some of the
resources these key organizations offer.
For example, NNPHI has taken on leading
an ongoing “spin off ” of the MLC, convening
the RWJF-funded Open Forum for Quality
Improvement, a biannual national meeting to
showcase CQI application and learnings in public health practice to support the ongoing community of practice started through the MLC.

NNPHI also provides quality improvement
training via the CDC’s Public Health Improvement Training (PHIT). PHF provides a free
searchable database for CQI resources and
offers a multitude of training and technical assistance programs to help public health
departments learn and apply CQI. Population
Health Improvement Partners offers numerous training and technical assistance programs
to help public health departments and their
community partners learn and apply CQI. In
addition, Population Health Improvement
Partners provides a free online set of resources
that includes a step-by-step guide for executing
a quality improvement project, online learning
modules, and a database of examples of quality
improvement projects. Both PHF and Population Health Improvement Partners have published extensively about their CQI work and
related lessons learned in public health settings.

Evidence-Based Strategies
and Programs
To improve public health, it is increasingly
acknowledged that the field has to generate,
and more effectively, apply evidence-based

strategies, interventions, and programs, while
avoiding investment in those that have uncertain benefit (other than in research and evaluation activities) or have been proven to have
no effect. The evidence base for public health
interventions is limited in some areas, and
additional funding for research on developing
new approaches and documenting the effectiveness of current public health interventions
is necessary (U.S. DHHS, 2009). However,
many evidence-based strategies, interventions,
and programs for improving health and preventing disease in communities are available
and catalogued in free online resources, such
as those as shown in TABLE 11.2.
To be effectively implemented, resources
such as these must also be available in a userfriendly and comprehensively described format with support for selection of community/
population appropriate interventions and programs, as well as providing comprehensive
support and resources for how to implement
them to support public health organizations
involved in improvement efforts at the community level. The Healthy North Carolina
Improvement App (IMAPP) is specifically
designed to bolster support for selection and

implementation, however, most of the interventions are currently focused on a single state’s
priorities. Fortunately, Population Health
Improvement Partners is partnering with the
Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) to
develop a national version of IMAPP to support the 100 Million Healthier Lives campaign
(IHI, 2017). More research and development is
needed to increase the availability and usability of evidence-based approaches; likewise,
more educational and training opportunities
are needed to ensure the effective application
of these approaches.

Innovative Partnerships
Local and state public health agencies alone cannot address many important public health problems, such as the increasing burden of chronic
diseases. There is growing recognition that a
coalition of partners from complementary organizations is often necessary. Public–private and
other innovative partnerships will likely become
increasingly important, especially as resources
for public health continue to contract in many
states. Local partnerships can be an excellent way
to leverage limited public health resources.
One major opportunity for innovative partnerships is the 2014 changes in IRS
requirements of nonprofit hospitals (78% of
U.S. hospitals) through the Affordable Care

Act (ACA), which mandates that they conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment
(CHNA) every 3 years and collaborate with
their local health department to do so, including developing strategies to address the priorities (James, 2016).
An excellent example of this type of collaboration in action is Western North Carolina (WNC) Healthy Impact. WNC Healthy
Impact is a partnership and coordinated process between hospitals, public health agencies,
and key regional partners in western North
Carolina, working toward a vision of improved
community health. Collectively, these entities
work together locally and regionally across 16
counties on a community health improvement
process to assess health needs, develop collaborative plans, take coordinated action, and evaluate progress and impact.
This locally-led and implemented initiative supports and enhances regional efforts by:
■
■
■
■

Standardizing and conducting data collection and analysis
Creating reporting and communication
templates and tools
Encouraging collaboration and peer
learning
Providing training and technical assistance (including Results Based Accountability™ and scorecards)

Factors Affecting the Ongoing Adoption and Institutionalization of CQI in Public Health

■
■

Supporting regional priorities
Sharing evidence-based and innovative
practices

This innovative regional partnership, supported by financial and in-kind contributions
from hospitals, public health agencies, and
partners, is housed and coordinated by WNC
Health Network, Inc., an alliance of hospitals
and partners in western North Carolina that
works to improve health and health care.
Private foundations have been another
major force driving innovative partnerships.
The RWJF Culture of Health effort is a wellknown national example, as is the Healthy
People, Healthy Carolinas Initiative. The Duke
Endowment, a private foundation focused on
improving health and well-being in North
Carolina and South Carolina communities, has
partnered with Population Health Improvement Partners and the South Carolina Alliance for Health to empower community health
improvement efforts by strengthening and
supporting local coalitions to improve health
in their communities. This initiative aims to
stimulate innovation in local partnerships and
improve community health by focusing on
supporting the implementation of evidencebased interventions targeting nutrition, physical activity, and prevention of chronic disease.
The initiative currently involves 10 local partnerships and plans to expand to a total of
35 partnerships by 2020.
Finally, numerous states have used innovative partnerships to enhance the adoption and
institutionalization of CQI in public health settings. For example, Population Health Improvement Partners, the North Carolina Division of
Public Health, the North Carolina Association
of Local Health Directors, the North Carolina
Area Health Educations Centers, and the North
Carolina Institute for Public Health partnered
to provide basic and advanced CQI training
for all local health departments and all state
health programmatic areas, beginning in 2009.
To date, nearly all of North Carolina’s 84 local
health departments have been trained, as have

277

dozens of state health department programs,
yielding impressive improvements and return
on investment (Davis et al., 2016; Crawley-Stout
et al., 2016). The Rhode Island Department of
Health has used multiple funding sources and
initiatives, such as its Home Visiting Collaborative Improvement & Innovation Network
(COIIN), to provide CQI training for numerous
state maternal and child health programs and
their staff and all of its local partner agencies in
collaboration with Population Health Improvement Partners.

Financing of Public Health
Organizations
In many states, governmental public health
agencies have been under substantial financial strain related to governmental austerity,
even during an expanding economy. In fact,
the CDC’s budget (nearly three-fourths of
which funds state and local communities)
has declined by over $1.5 billion (15%) in the
past decade (Segal & Martín, 2017). New and
innovative approaches to financing local and
state public health agencies are greatly needed
and can help improve the population’s health
as governmental funding is shrinking. For
instance, public health organizations could
benefit from testing and adapting financial
approaches that have been successful in other
industries, such as economic impact and
return on investment analyses.
CQI relates to these financial challenges
in at least three ways. First, implementing
CQI should help reduce overall costs while
increasing quality, just as it has in many other
industries and organizations (Spear & Bowen,
1999). Reducing costs and inefficiencies can
help increase capacity and allow for a greater
focus on population health improvement.
Indeed, the CDC and other U.S. DHHS agencies are beginning to tie incorporation of CQI
into their grants to state and local public health
agencies and programs. Second, if the financing of public health services remains focused

278

Chapter 11 Continuous Quality Improvement in U.S. Public Health Organizations

on funding specific services and programs
rather than infrastructure and other more flexible uses, then public health agencies will likely
have great difficulty investing in the infrastructure needed for CQI. Lesneski (2012) presents
a case study describing the link between quality management and the analysis of financial
indicators in a local health department. Finally,
and perhaps most importantly, we believe the
increasing focus on value (higher quality at a
lower cost) in the ongoing health care transformation in the United States, which is largely
driven by the ACA, and the need to control
the rapid increases in health care costs, will

drive health systems to have a greater focus on
improving the health of the populations they
serve. U.S. DHHS has set a goal of linking 50%
of Medicare fee-for-service payments to quality
or value through alternative payment models
by 2018 (CMS, 2017). An unhealthy population will have much higher health care costs,
thus opening the door for innovative funding
models between public health and health care
entities as they strive for the mutually beneficial
goal of improving the health of a population to
create higher health care value. (See Chapter 14
for further discussion of the importance of
focusing on value in health care and CQI).

CASE STUDY: INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF
CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT
This case study presents an example of a local public health agency that adopted and institutionalized
continuous quality improvement. As you read through the case, refer to the NACCHO Roadmap to a
Culture of Quality Improvement (NACCHO, 2013) and consider these questions:
■
■
■

According to the NACCHO Roadmap, which elements of a CQI culture are present and which
appear to be lacking?
What could the organization do to address elements that appear to be lacking?
What are three additional steps the organization could take to ensure sustainability of their
CQI efforts?

CQI in a Local Public Health Agency: Macon County, North Carolina
After becoming accredited through North Carolina’s accreditation program in 2008, the Macon
County, North Carolina, Public Health Department began to focus on changing its quality culture.
They established a QI council and part-time position for a quality program manager and began
to implement a quality improvement program. Over the course of 2 years, they trained staff and
leadership in quality improvement tools and methods, including Lean (see Chapters 4 and 5).
During this time, staff members completed small quality improvement projects, which helped them
apply the concepts they were learning and secure buy-in throughout the organization. After staff were
trained and had completed a few successful small-scale projects, the health department began focusing
on “projects that would have a greater impact on the organization’s overall performance, improve
patient/customer service outcomes, and achieve demonstrable cost savings.” One such project aimed
to improve the appointment scheduling process by seeing all patients within 72 hours of requesting an
appointment, while also improving patient and staff satisfaction. The team participated in a rapid cycle
improvement event (or, kaizen event) that involved using Lean and Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles, performing
a gemba walk (direct observation of the work), creating work flow diagrams and detailed process maps,
and generating and testing change ideas. Soon after, the clinics were scheduling patients for visits in less
than 72 hours. Their no-show rates decreased, visit numbers increased, staff downtime decreased, and
both patient and staff satisfaction increased.

279

Leveraging this success, the health department began to spread quality improvement initiatives
to other areas of the organization and focused on projects related to the client feedback process,
child health visit flow, and vaccine storage and management among others. To keep staff informed
of the organization’s quality improvement work, as well as foster ongoing staff engagement, the
health department keeps an electronic directory of their work (including project aim statements,
meeting notes, process maps and flow diagrams, as well as other team-related communication) and
highlights activities and results in the hallways of their organization. They also reinvest cost savings
from the projects into other vital activities of the health department. Overall, the health department’s
continuous improvement efforts have led to organizational efficiency as well as improved care and
patient experience (Bruckner, See, & Randolph, 2013).

Conclusions

The need to improve the public’s health in
the United States is evident. Although public
health organizations are still early in the process of institutionalizing CQI compared to
organizations in many other industries, they
have made remarkable progress and adoption
in the second decade of the 21st century, particularly with the support of accreditation locally
and nationally. The increased attention placed
on the adoption of CQI in public health is both
timely and encouraging. Numerous factors are
presented to explain the growth of CQI in public health and, most important, the substantial

progress that has been made toward true institutionalization of CQI in public health. Among
those factors is accreditation, with similarities
to the impact accreditation has had on health
care globally (see Chapter 12). Continuing to
use accreditation efforts to promote CQI and
learning from health care and other industries
will help accelerate widespread adoption and
institutionalization of CQI. Public health organizations that adopt CQI to help employees
work as a team, address gaps in performance
by analyzing and redesigning processes, and
encourage innovation to meet the needs of
communities hold the promise for a healthier
future, both in the United States and throughout the world.

CHAPTER 12

Health Service Accreditation:
A Strategy to Promote and
Improve Safety and Quality
David Greenfield and Marjorie Pawsey
Healthcare organizations have a mandate to provide the highest standard of care for patients and
their families. While it may be difficult to empirically demonstrate that an organization provides a
high standard of care using basic outcomes such
as mortality, the foundations of both measuring
and improving healthcare quality include consideration of adequate structures and processes of
care with proven relationships to better outcomes.
—Andre Amaral and
Brian Cuthbertson (2016, p. 824)

how accreditation programs have become a
common strategy to improve health organizations and care, including examining the
requirements and motivations to participate.
The chapter also considers the impact of continuous quality improvement within accreditation programs on organizations and care
delivered. Accreditation agencies, standards
and surveyor reliability are reviewed, with
public health accreditation programs in the
United States as a practical example.

he accreditation of health care services
remains a key regulatory mechanism
employed by many governments, at
both national and state levels, to monitor and
improve safety and quality. The objective of
this chapter is to provide an overview of health
service accreditation programs, outline health
service accreditation, including explaining the
current model of accreditation, and review

282

An Overview of
Accreditation

Health care organizations, services within them,
and individual professionals, can all be accredited. Health care organizations are accredited for
the management and provision of their services,
including hospitals, general practices, geriatric

An Overview of Accreditation

care facilities, and public health (Accreditation
Canada, 2016a; Ingram et al., 2014; The Joint
Commission, 2017). Within health care organizations, specialized health services can be
accredited, such as tissue banks (American
Association of Tissue Banks, 2017), pharmacies
(American College of Health-System Pharmacists, 2017), and aeromedical transportation services (Commission on Accreditation of Medical
Transport Systems, 2017). Additionally, programs or individual professionals from medical
(American Academy of Neurology, 2017), nursing (American Academy of Nurse Practitioners,
2017), and allied health fields (American Occupational Therapy Association, 2017; Council on
Podiatric Medical Education, 2017), and administrators, including medical administrators
(American Academy of Medical Management,
2018), are increasingly required to be certified.
Whether it is the organization, service or individual focused upon, accreditation is the action
whereby they have demonstrated competency,
authority, or credibility to meet a predetermined
set of standards. When successfully undertaken
they are awarded the status of being “accredited”
by a recognized, credible, designated authority.
In short, a health service accreditation program
is a mechanism that reviews and assesses an
organization’s quality improvement initiatives
and ongoing efforts to demonstrate that minimum safety and quality standards are being
achieved (Almasabi & Thomas, 2017; Carman &
Timsina, 2015; Devkaran & O’Farrell, 2015;
Haj-Ali et al., 2014; Hinchcliff, Greenfield,
Westbrook, et al., 2013; Jaafaripooyan, 2014;
Lanteigne & Bouchard, 2016; Teymourzadeh
et al., 2016; Yan & Kung, 2015).

Current Model of Health Service
Accreditation
The model of health service accreditation, enacted by many health accreditation

283

agencies, is similar. A breakdown of the process typically involved in this model is as
follows: An organization seeking to be accredited develops, implements, and continuously
reviews its quality improvement plan and
self-assesses progress against the standards of
the accreditation program. It concludes this
task by providing a written self-assessment
report to the accrediting agency. The accrediting agency assesses the organization’s report
and dispatches an accreditation survey team,
comprised of peer reviewers, to visit and
assess the organization on site. The visit comprises observations of facilities, interviews
with staff, and a review of documentation.
The survey team during and at the conclusion
of the survey provides verbal feedback to the
organization. The accrediting agency receives
a written report from the survey team a short
time after the visit. The report summarizes the
survey team’s assessment of the organization’s
progress in achieving the standards and makes
recommendations or commendations as
appropriate. Following the correction of any
errors of fact by the organization, the report
is then considered by the accrediting agency.
The agency assesses the report and decides
whether to award accreditation status or not.
Accreditation is in effect for a defined
period, typically for 3 to 5 years. It is common for accrediting agencies to send survey
teams to reassess an organization during
the accreditation period. The survey team
reviews the organization’s continual progress against the updated quality plan and
accreditation standards. The surveyors provide verbal feedback, and, after endorsement
by the accrediting agency, a written report is
provided to the organization. The improvement cycle continues, with the organization
using the report to initiate further reflection
and examination of its structures, processes,
and practices to identify and drive areas for
ongoing improvement.

Chapter 12 Health Service Accreditation: A Strategy to Promote and Improve Safety and Quality

Accreditation: A
Common Strategy
to Improve Health
Organizations and Care

Accreditation in health was first initiated in the
United States through the work of the American
College of Surgeons, which in 1917 developed
the Minimum Standards for Hospitals. This
organization subsequently collaborated with
colleges and associations from the United States
and Canada to create, in 1951, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals, which
is now referred to as The Joint Commission
(TJC). From this beginning, health care accreditation has spread to be practiced across the
world (Agrizzi, Agyemang, & Jaafaripooyan,
2016; Devkaran & O’Farrell, 2015; Shaw, 2015;
Teymourzadeh et al., 2016; Triantafillou, 2014).
Accreditation is now in more than 70 countries, including: Australia (ACSQHC, 2016;
Greenfield, Hinchcliff et al., 2016; Mumford,
Reeve, et al., 2015), Canada (Accreditation
Canada, 2016a; Mitchell et al., 2015), France
(Haute Autorité de Santé, 2015); Iran (Agrizzi,
Agyemang, & Jaafaripooyan, 2016; Mohebbifar
et al., 2017), Lebanon (Haj-Ali et al., 2014);
Pakistan (Sax and Marx, 2014), Saudi Arabia
(Aboshaiqah, Alonazi, & Patalagsa, 2016;
Almasabi & Thomas, 2016), Taiwan (Yan and
Kung, 2016), United Arab Emirates (Devkaran
& O’Farrell, 2015), and the United States (The
Joint Commission, 2016, 2017).
In the United States, TJC accredits more
than 4,000 organizations, or 88% of the hospitals in the country (The Joint Commission,
2016). The Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS)
accredits all acute health care organizations in
France, which total more than 700 hospitals
(Haute Autorité de Santé, 2015). Accreditation
Canada (Accreditation Canada, 2016b) and the
Australian Council on Healthcare Standards
(ACHS) (ACHS, 2016) each accredit more
than 1,000 and 800 organizations, respectively.

These, and many other major health care
accreditation agencies, are independent, notfor-profit, nongovernment agencies.
The uptake of accreditation has been,
in part, driven by governments (Agrizzi,
Agyemang, & Jaafaripooyan, 2016; Devkaran &
O’Farrell, 2015; Sax & Marx, 2014; Shaw, 2015;
Teymourzadeh et al., 2016; Thielen et al., 2014;
Triantafillou, 2014; Yan & Kung, 2015). They
have used accreditation programs and other
regulation strategies to attempt abatement or
control of risks to society by indirect means
(Agrizzi, Agyemang, & Jaafaripooyan, 2016;
Sparrow, 2000). Accreditation programs reflect
a shift in philosophy by governments whereby
they have sought to provide a framework for
the governance of services rather than to provide those services themselves. Accreditation is
an element in a network of activities that seeks
to regulate conduct in the health sector. Health
organizations are networked together, and their
behavior is assessed by independent bodies
through accreditation programs, standards, and
quality indicators. Regulation via this network
has been called “nodal governance” (Shearing
& Wood, 2003); that is, organizations, services, and professional behavior in health care
are shaped by an increasing variety of government and nongovernment bodies related to but
independent of each other (Triantafillou, 2014).
A further factor shaping organizational behavior is the public disclosure of accreditation information and results (Greenfield et al., 2013). The
idea has widespread support from governments,
health care organizations, and consumers, and
is implemented in practice by many agencies;
however, the production of information that is
meaningful and useable by consumers remains a
challenge. The main impact of the public disclosure of accreditation information is to stimulate
a positively reinforcing cycle of transparency
encouraging organizational accountability and
further improvement (Agrizzi, Agyemang, &
Jaafaripooyan, 2016; Greenfield et al., 2013).
There is an international agency, the
International Society for Quality in Health
Care (ISQua), that accredits the accreditors

Accreditation: A Process Promoting Continuous Quality Improvement

(ISQua, 2018). As of October 2016, ISQua
had accredited 68 accrediting organizations,
146 accreditation standards, and 30 surveyor
training programs (ISQua, 2018). ISQua promotes self-governance through their accrediting of accreditation agencies. That is, ISQua
members, themselves drawn from accrediting bodies, provide guidelines, support, and
assessment of accreditation and surveyor
training programs to one another. Furthermore, the self-governance modality is reinforced through ISQua’s encouragement of
participation in its organization and the international health quality and safety conferences
it convenes. Consequently, the work of ISQua
has evoked an international convergence of
understanding about, and similarity in the
enactment of, health accreditation programs.
The evidence base for health service accreditation programs continues to strengthen.
There have been calls, over many years,
for increased research, transparency, and
innovation into accreditation (Devkaran &
O’Farrell, 2015; Greenfield & Braithwaite,
2009; Hinchcliff, Greenfield, Moldovan, et al.,
2013). Research organizations and accrediting agencies have responded, particularly in
the last few years, undertaking an increasing number of studies (Agrizzi, Agyemang, &
Jaafaripooyan, 2016; Devkaran & O’Farrell,
2015; Hinchcliff, Greenfield, Moldovan, et al.,
2013; Teymourzadeh et al., 2016). This includes
those involving HAS, TJC, Accreditation
Canada, the ACHS, the Italian Society for Quality of Health Care, the Irish Health Services
Accreditation Board, and the Spanish accrediting agency, Fundación Avedis Donabedian.

Requirements and Motivations
to Participate in a Health Service
Accreditation Program
There are external requirements and internal
motivations that drive health care organizations
to seek accreditation (Greenfield & Braithwaite,
2008; Sax & Marx, 2014). An external

285

requirement comes from governments, insurers, and consumers demand that organizations
undertake efforts that demonstrate outcomes
that advance high-quality and safer health
care (Accreditation Canada, 2016c; Agrizzi,
Agyemang, & Jaafaripooyan, 2016; Shaw, 2015;
The Joint Commission, 2017). Individually, and
collectively, they seek to be reassured that organizations are making efforts to achieve published standards or address safety and quality.
The internal impetus comes from health professionals. They report a desire to improve their
services and the care they provide (Greenfield
& Braithwaite, 2008). Together these two motivations, which are mutually reinforcing, have
combined to draw many health care organizations under the umbrella of accreditation.
The external pressures and explicit regulatory requirements which necessitate participation in an accreditation program means the
distinction between voluntary and mandatory
accreditation programs is increasingly difficult to separate. The “choice” many organizations have is not whether to participate but
with which accrediting agency and program
they will be associated. In effect, health service
accreditation, in many countries, has become a
requirement in practice if not in name. Research
contrasting two programs, one mandated and
the other voluntary, found that both programs
incorporated compulsory and flexible elements.
There were positive impacts from both the
mandated and voluntary programs, and that
there was a convergence of the two approaches
(Greenfield, Hinchcliff et al., 2016; Shaw, 2015).

▸

Accreditation: A
Process Promoting
Continuous Quality
Improvement

Accreditation programs now require that organizations have structures and processes that
promote safety and quality, and also that they

286

Chapter 12 Health Service Accreditation: A Strategy to Promote and Improve Safety and Quality

are functioning effectively. These requirements
represent a philosophical shift from quality
assurance to continuous quality improvement
(Greenfield, Hinchcliff et al., 2016). The former
is regarded as a program that strives to improve
quality through defining and measuring it. The
latter incorporates both retrospective and prospective assessments, and is aimed at developing strategies to make things better and to
create systems to prevent errors (Lanteigne &
Bouchard, 2016). While the continuous quality
improvement model is the dominant accreditation model for health care organizations, there
is an alternative, more generic model that can
be described as an “audit model.” In this model,
an external reviewer, with or without health
care experience, uses a generic set of quality
standards to assess the presence or absence of
organizational quality activities. This model is
endorsed by the International Organization for
Standardization, which accredits organizations
in many diverse industries, including health
(see the International Organization for Standardization website).
In simple terms, continuous quality
improvement involves health professionals
constantly asking themselves, “Despite having
the ‘right’ things in place to do the ‘right’ things,
what are we doing now that we can do better?”
Furthermore, accreditation is about answering the question posed by external assessors:
“What systems have you implemented, how do
they work, and can you show me how you are
planning to do things better?” The shift can be
illustrated by an example concerning patient
satisfaction surveys. An accreditation program
promoting a quality assurance approach would
focus on a patient satisfaction survey and how it
is developed and administered. In contrast, an
accreditation program with a quality improvement philosophy would focus on the response
rate of the surveys, the issues identified by the
patients, the organization’s actions, and confirmation of improvement in subsequent surveys.
There is still much to be learnt about
under what circumstances and how an accreditation program fosters quality improvement

and learning (Devkaran & O’Farrell, 2015;
Hinchcliff, Greenfield, Moldovan, et al., 2013;
Jaafaripooyan, 2014; Melo, 2016; Riley et al.,
2012; Shaw, 2015; Yan & Kung, 2015). With
each revision of standards, there remains debate
about whether we keep raising the bar to stimulate efforts to improve—or will this strategy
promote adverse behaviors? Knowing how best
to stimulate improvements in quality and safety
in health systems facing significant cost pressures and increasing demands is a challenge
for governments, health care organizations,
and professionals. Many health professionals, whether they participate in accreditation
activities directly, indirectly, or not at all, seem
to hold strong opinions about the value and
benefits, or lack thereof. The topic generates
polarized views. Professionals who do and
do not participate in accreditation efforts can
perceive the efforts as external bureaucratic
reporting mechanisms (Agrizzi, Agyemang, &
Jaafaripooyan, 2016; Jaafaripooyan, 2014).
Conversely, participating in accreditation cultivates communication and cooperation among
individuals and teams, and promotes a positive
quality and safety culture, thereby promoting
change in an organization (Beatty et al., 2015;
Hinchcliff, Greenfield, Moldovan, et al., 2013;
Melo, 2016; Verma & Moran, 2014).
Accreditation programs, encompassing
the continuous quality improvement principle,
are noted to have improved the organization of
facilities, policies and guidelines, decision making, and safety (Abou Elnour et al., 2014; Davis
et al., 2011; Greenfield & Braithwaite, 2008;
Hinchcliff, Greenfield, Moldovan, et al., 2013;
Melo, 2016; Shaw, 2015; Yan & Kung, 2015). An
accreditation program provides a structured
framework for engagement and improvement
(Abou Elnour et al., 2014; Verma & Moran,
2014). Health care professionals perceived
accreditation programs as a strategy for promoting and making transparent quality and collegial decision making. An accreditation program
has been shown to stimulate an organization to
sustain improvements over the accreditation
cycle (Devkaran & O’Farrell, 2015). Similarly, in

Accreditation Agencies, Standards, and Surveyor Reliability

an acute teaching hospital in Portugal, an
accreditation program stimulated improvement though promoting staff reflection on their
work, standardization of practices, building
upon existing processes, and focusing attention
on quality improvement (Melo, 2016). Accredited hospitals formalize, and at times realize,
improvements in quality management practices
(Braithwaite et al., 2010; Devkaran & O’Farrell, 2015; Hinchcliff, Greenfield, Moldovan,
et al., 2013; Jaafaripooyan, 2014; Melo, 2016).
In Taiwan, organizational team learning and
hospital accreditation awareness was correlated
(Yan & Kung, 2015, 2016) and considered to
be a viable strategy for improving quality and
safety of medical care. Positive correlations were
found between accreditation performance and
organizational culture and leadership, additionally, a positive trend was noted with clinical
performance; however, no link was identified to
organizational climate (Braithwaite et al., 2010).
In other studies, however, there are more
mixed outcomes. There was no impact on quality outcomes from one program (Almasabi &
Thomas, 2016). In another case, the program
was seen to bring benefits (e.g., external recognition), as well as drawbacks for individual
clinicians (e.g., routinization) (Jaafaripooyan,
2014). Similarly, organizations have undergone improvement processes but failed to
reach the standard required by the accreditation program (Lanteigne & Bouchard, 2016).
Accreditation has an undefined impact
on patient views or satisfaction reports. A
positive effect from accreditation on patient
satisfaction has been reported (Alkhenizan
& Shaw, 2011) but not identified in other
circumstances (Haj-Ali et al., 2014; Mohebbifar et al., 2017). Accredited organizations
were perceived by patients as only marginally better than nonaccredited organizations
in one study, and the role of accreditation
was unclear (Aboshaiqah, Alonazi, & Patalagsa, 2016). Accreditation was unrelated
to consumer involvement in another study
(Braithwaite et al., 2010). The understanding
is that an accreditation program improvement

287

targets aspects of organizations that are less
visible to patients and this mitigates against
a relationship between the two issues being
identified (Hinchcliff, Greenfield, Moldovan,
et al., 2013).
Additionally, there is an ongoing debate
about the cost of accreditation programs
(Hinchcliff, Greenfield, Moldovan, et al., 2013;
Mumford, Forde, Greenfield, Hinchcliff, &
Braithwaite, 2013; Mumford, Greenfield, et al.,
2013; Mumford, Reeve, et al., 2015). The financial impact for accreditation was reported
as proportionally greater for smaller organizations and considered by some to be high
overall (Mumford, Greenfield, et al., 2015).
However, the argument has been made that the
costs incurred are not additional but part of an
organization’s required investment in quality
(Hinchcliff, Greenfield, Moldovan, et al., 2013;
Mumford, Forde, et al., 2013; Mumford, Reeve,
et al., 2015).

Accreditation
Agencies, Standards,
and Surveyor
Reliability

Accreditation Agencies
Accreditation agencies that assess organizations and services against standards,
develop and supervise peer reviewers to
maintain a surveyor workforce. Surveyors
are a key element of accreditation programs
(Teymourzadeh et al., 2016). Accrediting
agencies can have surveyor workforces comprised of full-time or part-time surveyors,
and they may be on salary, paid a stipend or
voluntary. The ongoing support and development of this workforce requires careful
management and surveyor workforce sustainability is an ongoing challenge for accreditation agencies. Accrediting agencies need to
be able to continually recruit appropriately

288

Chapter 12 Health Service Accreditation: A Strategy to Promote and Improve Safety and Quality

experienced health professionals as surveyors
(Teymourzadeh et al., 2016). However, their
regular employment can be incompatible with
the time required to participate as a surveyor.
Nevertheless, accrediting agencies are continually renewing their workforces. Individuals
gain benefits from surveying and it provides
value to the institutions in which they are regularly employed (Lancaster, Braithwaite, &
Greenfield, 2010; Teymourzadeh et al., 2016).
Health professionals who act as volunteer
surveyors derive four benefits from doing so,
that is, the opportunity to: be exposed to new
methods and innovations in health organizations; engage in a unique form of professional
development; acquire expertise to enhance
quality within the institutions in which they
are regularly employed; and contribute to the
process of quality improvement and enhance
public health in organizations beyond their
regular employment.
The status of the accreditation program,
whether mandatory or voluntary, shapes the
focus of the role and others’ perceptions. The
surveyor role is a demanding one, including
acting as educator, judge, evaluator, regulator,
or a combination of these functions (Greenfield,
Braithwaite, Pawsey, 2008; Sax & Marx, 2014).
A health professional taking on the surveyor
role may be comfortable with some part but not
others, or with combining the roles. Additionally, potential or perceived conflict of interest
issues have been raised when health professionals are surveying colleagues and organizations
with which they have ties or with which they
may seek to work in the future (Plebani, 2001).
Correspondingly, accreditation agencies have
instigated policies requiring surveyors to disclose any real or perceived conflicts.
Accreditation agencies, involving many
of their stakeholders, have constructed a selfgoverning system (Greenfield, Pawsey, Naylor,
Braithwaite, 2009). It is a system responsive to
the conduct and culture of those being regulated; this approach has been labeled “responsive regulation” (Sax & Marx, 2014). The system
seeks to influence the attitudes and practices of

those involved, whether they are in the role of
accreditation agency personnel, surveyors, or
health staff in an organization being accredited
(Ingram et al., 2014). Through participation in
the development of accreditation programs or
the accrediting of health care organizations,
a common understanding of standards and
shared expectations is constructed. Additionally, participants regulate their own and other
colleagues’ behaviors to comply with the standards and expectations. The system combines
internal assessment, or self-regulation, with
self-directed improvement strategies overseen
by external peer review. It is a cultural control
strategy whose influence is significant on those
directly involved (Greenfield et al., 2009; Sax &
Marx, 2014). Those health professionals who
participate in their organization’s accreditation
activities generally report improvements to
quality and safety.

Accreditation Standards
Government bodies or accrediting agencies
can be responsible for the development and
revision of standards. It is common for either to
develop standards using representatives drawn
from the health industry, including combinations of health care experts, researchers, representatives from industry groups, consumers,
and governmental agencies; for example, in the
United States (The Joint Commission, 2017),
Canada (Accreditation Canada, 2016c), France
(Haute Autorité de Santé, 2015), and Australia
(ACSQHC, 2016), standards are developed
through consultation with a wide range of
stakeholders. The description, number and
status of standards, vary from accreditation
program to program. For the accreditation
of hospitals, Accreditation Canada has four
core standards within its Qmemtum program
(Accreditation Canada, 2016d), HAS, the
French accreditation agency, has 28 standards
and 82 criteria (Haute Autorité de Santé, 2015),
and the Australian Commission on Safety and
Quality in Health Care program has 10 standards (ACSQHC, 2016). By contrast, the

Accreditation Agencies, Standards, and Surveyor Reliability

United States the Public Health Accreditation
Board (PHAB) program has 12 domains with
multiple standards under each (PHAB, 2014).
Accreditation standards cover infrastructure,
organizational, service, and continuum of
patient care issues (Greenfield & Braithwaite,
2008; Hinchcliff, Greenfield, Moldovan, et al.,
2013; Mitchell et al., 2015; Haute Autorité de
Santé, 2015). Standards are focused on organizational processes and systems, and the
availability of appropriate resources for the
organization to deliver the defined services.
These types of standards have been termed
“process indicators,” as they focus on how
care is delivered rather than the outcomes of
the activity.
Concerns have been raised that when
standards do not reflect the outcomes of
care, they are not examining all dimensions
of quality and safety. Quality indicators are
advocated as being more effective measures.
However, the use of quality indicators within
an accreditation program continues to present many challenges (Hinchcliff, Greenfield,
Moldovan, et al., 2013; Mumford, Reeve, et al.,
2015). At present, the relationship between
accreditation and quality measures—clinical
indicators, quality indicators, or clinical performance measures—is not clear (Beatty et al.,
2015; Hinchcliff, Greenfield, Moldovan, et al.,
2013). Accreditation has been shown to generate improvement in some cases but not in
others. The use of quality indicators is likely
to remain problematic until the relationship
between accreditation and quality indicators
is clarified (Hinchcliff, Greenfield, Moldovan,
et al., 2013). The question is whether we
should expect to find a link between accreditation and different quality measures, given
they are developed and implemented separately and not linked. The issue remains unresolved as to whether they examine similar or
different aspects of health care performance
and quality; the point has been made that they
are in fact measuring different aspects of the
safety and quality spectrum (Mumford et al.,
2014). Nevertheless, concern continues to

289

be expressed about the lack of a relationship
between the two, and the argument persists
that this issue needs further investigation
(Hinchcliff, Greenfield, Moldovan, et al., 2013;
Mumford et al., 2014).
Accrediting agencies are increasingly
examining strategies to expand programs
or standards to incorporate organizational
performance and clinical measures (Accreditation Canada, 2016c; ACHS, 2016; Haute
Autorité de Santé, 2015; The Joint Commission, 2016). Accreditation Canada’s program
Qmentum, uses evidence-based “Required
Organizational Practices” “to mitigate risk
and contribute to improving the quality and
safety of health services” (Accreditation
Canada, 2016d). The measures are used to
direct surveyors to examine particular parts
of an organization requiring close assessment
(Mitchell et al., 2015). Alternatively, outcome
measures are being reported upon separately
to accreditation surveys. Accreditation agencies are producing reports of organizational
and clinical compliance with expected guidelines to raise awareness across the industry.
For example, in the United States, since 2006,
the TJC has tracked and reported upon quality of care measures called “accountability
measures” (The Joint Commission, 2016).
These items are evidence-based, standardized, national measures that allow comparisons across organizations. In 2016, the TJC
reported on 29 measures (down from 45 the
previous year with the others retired due to
excellent quality performance by TJC accredited hospitals), with data drawn from more
than 3,000 accredited hospitals. In particular,
the 2016 report documents increased quality
performance results in inpatient psychiatric
services, venous thromboembolism (VTE)
care, stroke care, perinatal care, tobacco use
treatment, and substance use care. The report
notes that room for improvement exists and
there was a decline in the composite accountability score, probably due to the retirement of
measures on which many hospitals were performing extremely well.

290

Chapter 12 Health Service Accreditation: A Strategy to Promote and Improve Safety and Quality

As these examples demonstrate, the use
of quality of care measures in accreditation
surveys and the publication of compliance
reports are strategies by which accreditation
agencies are working with health organizations to assess, measure, and improve their
care. Their use forms part of the system of
self-governance within and across health
organizations. The place of quality indicators
within an accreditation program is an important one with which to come to terms. How
do organizations use the results from process and quality indicators and accreditation
programs? Are they used independently or
together? How do we resolve the differences
in their findings?

Surveyor Reliability
Reliability is noted as being a critical issue in
accreditation, and in health care more broadly.
Being able to conduct consistent assessments,
interpretations, and judgments, individually
and collectively, is a challenge for professionals working in many areas of health care
(Greenfield et al., 2009). As such, the challenges of consistency faced by accreditation
surveyors are not unique, and surveyors will
have encountered them in their normal professional activities. Reliability in accreditation
is a concern for accreditation agencies and
organizations that have been or are considering going through the accreditation process.
Effectively sustaining, developing, and managing a surveyor workforce to maintain and
increase the reliability of assessments is a key
focus for accrediting agencies (Greenfield,
Hogden et al., 2016; Teymourzadeh et al.,
2016). When enacting the surveyor role, intraand inter-rater reliability are issues of note
(Greenfield et al., 2009; Greenfield, Hogden
et al., 2016; Teymourzadeh et al., 2016). It is
important to distinguish between intra- and
inter-rater reliability. Intra-rater reliability is
high when the assessments made by an individual surveyor or survey team are consistent
from case to case. Inter-rater reliability is high

when assessments made by different surveyors or survey teams are consistent with one
another. Accreditation agencies that use fulltime surveyors see this as a strategy that can
work toward increasing the mastery of survey
techniques and more consistent interpretation
of standards. Conversely, part-time surveyors
have current knowledge of the health system,
management practices, and clinical expectations, but may not be as consistent in surveying as their full-time colleagues.
Accreditation surveying is an activity
based on document analysis, observations,
and interviews, hence survey findings need
to be credible and verifiable (Greenfield,
Braithwaite, Pawsey, 2008; Greenfield et al.,
2009). Survey teams use these three qualitative
data collection methods (document analysis, observations, and interviews) to triangulate their assessments. The results produced
through this complex process are not precisely
replicable, as human judgments are central to
the data collection and analysis process. Nevertheless, striving for rigor in application of
standards, individual and team conduct, and
transparency in interpretation and decision
making is essential (Greenfield, Hogden et al.,
2016). Hence the assessment that “Where
surveyors and survey teams achieve process
consistency and program interpretation from
survey to survey, their findings can then be
said to be reliable” (Greenfield et al., 2009).
In other words, accreditation agencies, rather
than focusing on reliability of outcome, need
to be encouraged to implement strategies
to promote and ensure reliability of process and consistent application of standards
(Greenfield et al., 2009; Greenfield, Hogden
et al., 2016; Teymourzadeh et al., 2016).
Reliability in surveying has been shown
to be promoted or undermined by multiple
factors (Greenfield et al., 2009; Greenfield,
Hogden et al., 2016; Sax & Marx, 2014). These
include: the accreditation program, including
documentation requirements for organizations and survey teams; member relationship
with the accrediting agency and survey team;

Public Health Accreditation in the United States

accreditation agency personnel; surveyor
workforce renewal; management of the surveyor workforce; performance review of surveyors; and, survey dynamics’ effect on the
reliability of surveys directly and indirectly.
Reliability in the accreditation process is constructed through the interplay of these factors.
They realize shared expectations and conduct
among stakeholders; together they promote
standardized beliefs and actions that become
accreditation cultural norms (Greenfield et al.,
2009; Greenfield, Hogden et al., 2016; Sax &
Marx, 2014). Reliability is an ongoing achievement, to be enacted each and every time a
survey team undertakes the task of assessing
an organization (Greenfield, Hogden et al.,
2016). Two studies developed scenario exercises, using real data, for individual surveyors
and survey teams to examine the respective
issues. Individual surveyors assessed, at two
points in time, scenarios of individual standards relating to a large hospital, and their
results were compared. The findings revealed
that intra-rater reliability is problematic; that
is, individuals struggle to consistently make
consistent assessments. A 20% variation in
surveyors’ individual assessments that potentially could have affected accreditation outcomes was noted (Greenfield et al., 2009).
Similarly, scenarios based on real data and
comprising written information and a roleplay were developed and presented to survey
teams. In contrast to the intra-rater findings,
the results showed that the examination of
the inter-rater reliability of survey teams
demonstrated more consistent agreement
(Greenfield, Pawsey, Naylor, & Braithwaite,
2008), thus highlighting the mediating effect
of teams on individuals.
Differences in how surveyors approach
their role can be misinterpreted as a lack of
reliability. A typology, using the dimensions
of recording (explicit/implicit) and questioning (opportunistic/structured), classifies four accreditation surveyor styles: the
discusser, the explorer, the interrogator,
and the questioner (Greenfield, Braithwaite,

291

Pawsey, 2008). In each case the surveyor
enacts the role according to their individual
preferences, strengths, and interpretation of
the survey situation. All have strengths and
weakness, depending on the circumstance,
no one approach is better than the others.
However, each presentation is distinctive to
the others and open to misinterpretation,
and can be poorly performed, thus affecting
reliability. The typology is suggested for use
by accreditation agencies in their surveyor
training programs, to explore issues of reliability and teamwork, and offers the opportunity to match teams of surveyors with a blend
of approaches.

Public Health
Accreditation in the
United States

Public health accreditation programs, specifically in the United States, are now an important driver of improvement (Thielen et al.,
2014; Verma & Moran, 2014) and strengthening public health infrastructure (Beatty
et al., 2018; Bender et al., 2014; McLees et al.,
2014; Singleton et al., 2014); these points are
also emphasized in Chapter 11 of this text.
Launched in 2011, the Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) is leading a voluntary
national public health accreditation initiative
(Bender et al., 2014; Riley, Bender, & Lownik,
2012) (see the overview section of the Public
Health Accreditation Board website). Increasingly more local health departments (LHDs)
are seeking PHAB accreditation (Meyerson
et al., 2015; Yeager et al., 2016); as of May 2016,
134 LHDs have been awarded accreditation
and 176 are undergoing the process (Kronstadt
et al., 2016).
The PHAB program has been advocated
as a strategy LHDs could use to improve their
operations, efficiency, and receive recognition
from meeting national industry standards

292

Chapter 12 Health Service Accreditation: A Strategy to Promote and Improve Safety and Quality

(Carman, Timsina, & Scutchfield, 2014;
Carman & Timsina, 2015). There is recognition of synergies between preparing for PHAB
accreditation and the work of other agencies,
including: the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention’s public health preparedness
(Singleton et al., 2014); the Guide to Community Preventive Services (Mercer et al., 2014);
collaborating with nonprofit hospitals to conduct community health needs assessments
(Singh & Carlton, 2017); and, the Malcolm
Baldrige Award for Excellence (Gorenflo et al.,
2014). If a LHD would pursue accreditation,
or not, has been shown to be determined by
the perception as to whether it would impact
future funding or performance (Meyerson
et al., 2016). Technical assistance was reported
as a key initiating factor as well (Meyerson
et al., 2015). Prior experience with quality
improvement activities has been noted as a
contributing factor (Chen et al., 2015; Yeager
et al., 2015); conversely, being accredited was
seen as strengthening a LHDs quality improvement activities (Madamala et al., 2012). Similarly, if a LHD has completed prerequisites for
accreditation and collaborated with other similar bodies then they are orientated to seeking accreditation (Beatty et al., 2015; McLees
et al., 2014). Concerns remain, however,
for some LHDs who cite the benefits do not
match the time, effort, and cost required for
accreditation; additionally, some LHDs consider they do not have the capacity to meet the
program standards (Beatty et al., 2015; Shah
et al., 2015). Rural LHDs, in particular, are
identified as being at a disadvantage of lacking staff and resources to do so (Beatty et al.,
2018). Accreditation of LHDs in North Carolina is recognized as being amongst the early
adopters and best in the United States (Davis
et al., 2011; Pestronk et al., 2014; Randolph,
Bruckner, & See, 2013). LHDs from across the
State conducted activities for improvement,
acted on suggestions for improvement and
were accredited. They reported improvements
in local partnerships as a key benefit from the
activity, however many LHDs also identified

time and schedule limitations as challenges in
the process (Davis et al., 2011). The development of the North Carolina LHD accreditation program is described by Stone and Davis
(2012) using a case study format.

Conclusions

Accreditation has been instituted, and has
become institutionalized, in health care sectors and jurisdictions around the world. It
is a governance strategy that enables health
organizations individually and collectively to
standardize and self-govern their efforts at
improving quality and safety. Accreditation
has resulted in improvements and benefits to
organization and delivery of care; nevertheless,
several significant challenges remain. The sustainability of the current program model and
need for further evolution of the component
parts, including standards and surveyor workforces, will continue. These are perennial issues
inherent in the accreditation, safety, and quality fields. Understanding the role of process
and quality indicators within an accreditation
program or their relationship to accreditation
results is a key one. Differences in findings
between them is often associated with unnecessary angst and consternation about the value
of accreditation programs. Studies in the field
of implementation science are demonstrating
how organizational context and human factors matter influence outcomes. It is expected
the next few years will shed further light on
how and why these variations emerge, and the
issue will be reconciled. Clarifying the distinction between the costs associated with implementing safety and quality systems, and those
with participation in an accreditation program
requires further attention. The difference is
confused by many and results in false claims
about the cost of accreditation activities. A
strength of the field is that accreditation agencies and their partners continue to investigate
the organizational and clinical impacts of their
programs, and share the knowledge generated.

CHAPTER 13

Quality Improvement in Lowand Middle-Income Countries

We need a quality revolution.

T

here has been a growing recognition
over the last few decades of the importance of the quality gap in health care
and public health programs delivery in many
low- and middle-income countries. This gap
is critical because poor outcomes are still
seen in many conditions (such as maternal
and child health, HIV, TB, and noncommunicable chronic diseases), despite significant
progress over the past 2 decades in expanding
access to these services and work to implement evidence-based interventions known to
save lives and increased community access to
and utilization of health care (Akachi & Kruk,
2017). This finding of increased access and
use with limited benefits is largely due to the
quality gap, similar to challenges described
in the higher income countries. For example,
policies to increase demand for and access to
care such as the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY)
in India that provides cash to women delivering in facilities have been very successful

in getting women to facilities, but have failed
to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality
because of poor quality of care in the facilities (Randive, Diwan, & De Costa, 2013). In
this chapter, we discuss some of the growing
knowledge and persisting challenges in measuring quality and applying Quality Improvement (QI) methods to solve health problems
in low- and middle-income settings, as well as
recent successes and areas where more learning is needed.

Variation in Health
Outcomes

While multiple factors impact how long individuals live, differences in the quality of the
health care delivery system and the care it
produces are a major contributor to the variation in life expectancy between countries
with similar income levels. Life expectancy
and a nation’s economic level are not always
correlated, partly because of differences
in both the level and priorities of funding
needed to strengthen the primary care-based

health care delivery systems that are critical to saving lives. For example, the United
States and Chile have about the same life
expectancy (78 years), although their populations experience a threefold difference in
their average per capita income. The need to
ensure effective use of health care funds is
also apparent from variations in health outcomes and improvement in countries with
similar levels of health care investments.
For example, under-five mortality rates and
quality of diarrheal care are similar in Cambodia and in the Philippines despite much
higher per capita spending on health care in
the Philippines (TABLE 13.1). This variability
supports the knowledge that simply increasing spending will not bridge the gap between
desired outcomes and those achieved.
While the lack of adequate resources do
contribute to differential health outcomes
between higher- and lower-income countries, the inability of health systems and care
delivery processes in facilities and communities to deliver care that meets the six
dimensions of quality (safety, effectiveness,
patient-centeredness, timeliness, efficiency,
and equity) defined by the Institute of Medicine is a greater factor in many countries
(Das & Hammer, 2014; Kruk, Chukwuma, &
Leslie, 2017; Singh et al., 2016). This has led

to the realization that effective and sustainable improvements in population health will
require the use of QI methods in health care
and public health systems to ensure the delivery of care that meets the needs of individuals
and populations now and in the future.

▸

New Challenges and
Opportunities for QI

In addition to the need to address gaps in
health outcomes and care quality that have
persisted for decades, there are a number of
emerging challenges that have provided more
reasons for increasing the use of QI. First,
the epidemiology of global burden of disease is changing—arising from scale-up of
effective HIV treatment, reduction of other
communicable diseases, rural to urban population shifts, and a rising burden of noncommunicable chronic diseases including
diabetes and cardiovascular disease (GBD
Collaborators, 2016). This shift has resulted
in increased need to build integrated,
people-centered health care requiring facilities and systems to establish resilient processes for delivering comprehensive quality
health care that meets the evolving range of

QI Frameworks and Methods

population health needs including longitudinal care, coordinating referrals to specialists and hospitals as needed, and integrating
health promotion and treatment (Bitton et al.,
2017). Second, there has been a push toward
sharing or shifting tasks, both from specialist to generalist medical staff and from
facility-based health providers to community
health workers. These changes are designed
to increase access by expanding the range
of providers, who need to be supported to
deliver quality care (Perry, Zulliger, & Rogers,
2014). Third, international goals, such as the
health-related sustainable development goal
(SDG) “to ensure healthy lives and promote
well-being at all ages” (Paule et al., 2017), and
the new global HIV targets of 90-90-90 (90%
of people with HIV aware of their diagnosis,
90% in care, and 90% with effective treatment defined as viral suppression) are only
achievable through systematic improvements
in the quality of care. To reach the SDG targets, there is recognition that countries need
universal health coverage, which also means
universally high-quality care to achieve better outcomes and quality of life regardless of
setting. Finally, the Ebola outbreak in 2014
represents another type of challenge because
it highlighted the dangers and costs of poor
quality of care as well as the often neglected
quality domain of safety for patients and their
providers (Boozary, Farmer, & Jha, 2014).

▸

QI Frameworks and
Methods

There are a number of frameworks and
approaches to improve quality that can be
implemented in low- and middle-income
countries, with a growing evidence base from
experiences at the national and local levels in
these countries. Over 50 years ago, Donabedian
(1988, 2005) developed a model for assessing
the quality of health care based on an analysis of the structure (i.e., the context in which

299

health care is delivered and the systems),
the processes of delivery, and the outcomes
that are achieved. In 2007, the World Health
Organization (WHO) developed a framework designed to help countries strengthen
the health systems needed to improve population health. This framework was based on
“six pillars” of inputs: health services, information, workforce, commodities, financing,
and leadership/governance (WHO, 2007).
The WHO framework tracks the link between
these important resources through quality to
improved population and individual health.
Recognizing that simply improving the infrastructure to deliver care does not guarantee
the improved quality and quantity of health
that are the goals of health care systems (Kruk
et al., 2016); more recent frameworks targeting low- and middle-income countries have
focused on the processes of delivery of care
and systems required to ensure that delivery is
people-centered and responsive to the needs
and priorities of the communities served
(Primary Health Care Performance Initiative,
n.d.; WHO, 2015). Only through improving
all aspects of the health system—improved
delivery of health services, timely availability
of the right commodities, adequate financial
and human resources, and appropriate leadership and policies—can quality be ensured
and health outcomes achieved. This will likely
be achieved by a combination of more locally
targeted QI, such as value mapping through
Lean (see Chapter 5), and supporting supervision combined with broader, national-level
system redesign and national policies and
strategies to support governance for quality
(Ramaswamy et al., 2017; Magge et al., 2014;
WHO, 2017b).
QI methods, which emphasize the use
of data to inform systematic approaches to
reduce variation in the quality of care across
varied contexts, are well suited to help advance
the work to ensure quality. These methods
have been used extensively to strengthen systems in higher-resource settings (Berwick,
1996) and their applicability in strengthening

300

Chapter 13 Quality Improvement in Low- and Middle-Income Countries

health systems in resource-limited settings
is widely recognized (Leatherman et al.,
2010). The remarkable improvements in
maternal and child health described in Brazil
(Macinko, Harris, & Rocha, 2017), Rwanda
(Farmer et al., 2013), Costa Rica (Pesec
et al., 2017), and a number of other countries (Moucheraud et al., 2016; Ruducha
et al., 2017) have been attributed to systems
strengthening work both at the macro level
(stronger governance and leadership, policies
and standards, adequate funding, established
processes and protocols for care, supporting expanded access to quality delivery of
evidence based interventions known to save
lives, etc.) and improving quality at the facility and subnational levels through local QI
programs and projects. One clear example is
observed by comparing under-five mortality
rates in low- and middle-income countries
between 1990 and 2016. For example, in
Sub-Saharan African countries , under-five
mortality rates fell from 183 per 1,000 live
births in 1990 to 79 in 2016 (UNICEF, 2018).
(Please see UNICEF website that is cited here
for annual updates of under-five mortality and other health indices by country and
region.) Despite this progress, widespread
adoption of QI and accompanying quality
assurance and quality control into national
policies and governance as well as global and
national investments and implementation
of improvement efforts at the level of community health systems has been slow. Moreover, the capability to make improvements
between countries and within and across
income levels has been limited to date.
The most popular QI methods to address
process and local system change include those
that have been defined and illustrated in a
broad range of settings throughout this text,
such as the Model for Improvement, Rapid
Cycle Change (Plan-Do-Study-Act [PDSA]),
Quality Improvement Collaboratives, Lean,
and Six Sigma (Chapter 5). The optimal
method to use depends on the goals and contextual factors, and there is little evaluation

evidence to definitively recommend one
method over another. In the sections that follow we briefly describe these methods and
provide some examples of their use in low- and
middle-income countries.

Quality Improvement Principles
While there is growing work to improve
the policies, strategies, and macro-level
approaches to improve quality, the fundamental assumption behind the QI approaches
highlighted in this chapter is that work in any
system is conducted through processes. One
definition of process is “a collection of activities that takes one or more kinds of input
and creates an output that is of value to the
customer” (Hammer & Champy, 1993). For
example, health care workers at a clinic follow a process of care from registration, to
examination, to diagnosis, to treatment, to
discharge, and billing. A community-level
Ebola eradication effort might involve processes related to case finding, infection control, prevention activities, transport to clinics,
and care. These QI methods, are particularly
applicable to countries where progress in outcomes has not been seen despite successful
investments in building health care facilities to ensure geographic access (Das, 2011;
Gage et al., 2017). Transforming a system,
regardless of the setting, therefore requires
improving processes. Quantitative methods
for understanding and improving processes,
including the use of process behavior charts,
play a central role in QI and were described
in Chapter 4.
This focus on processes has three
implications:
1.

QI often comes about by changing
components of or the whole process, not only a single individual
step. For example, delays in seeing
patients may come from inefficiencies in several interrelated process
steps, so addressing just one step
is not likely to result in significant

QI Frameworks and Methods

2.

3.

improvement and may even make
the problem worse.
All processes have a customer targeted to receive their outputs. In the
health system context, depending
on the process, the customer could
be a service provider, the recipient
of a service such as a patient, or a
community member. Therefore, at
the individual or population levels,
QI should result in a change that
ultimately improves the targeted
outcomes for a person or a community. Keeping the focus on the
customer helps define the goals of
an effective QI effort.
The goal of QI is to change the
process in a way that adds value
to the customer or patient and
reduces variation. In QI terminology, value is the opposite of waste,
which refers to process activities
that add no benefit to a patient’s
care or experience. Value can be
defined as better health outcomes
(including patient-reported outcomes) through higher quality of
care, but there are other ways in
which value could be measured.
Reduced delays, fewer errors,
respectful treatment of patients,
fewer contact points are all examples of how QI can add value and
increase safety. Often adding more
people or building more facilities
are proposed as improvement solutions. But these kinds of solutions
may not always add value because
they may just support the workings of a bad process. A commonly
quoted aphorism in QI states that
“all improvement is change, but
not all change is improvement.” QI
involves changing the process in
ways that adds value from the perspective of the targeted customer
(see Chapter 14).

The Model for Improvement,
PDSA, and Quality Improvement
Collaboratives
The Model for Improvement, developed by
the Associates in Process Improvement, helps
to structure the thinking and activities that
are needed to improve a health care system
or specific process (Langley et al., 2009). The
model is designed to help teams and organizations determine where to start, what to do,
and how to measure change (the three basic
questions of the inquiry component). The
actual improvement work is then done typically through the application of PDSA cycles
(FIGURE 13.1). These cycles, which promote the

Chapter 13 Quality Improvement in Low- and Middle-Income Countries

concept of small, iterative tests of change to
assess whether they can become part of a larger
change package that can be integrated into the
system, are core to most process-focused QI.
The model has also been implemented
across facilities targeting a common goal
using Quality Improvement Collaboratives in
a number of low- and middle-income countries. The Collaboratives are organized into
“learning sessions” where groups are trained in
the basics of the Model for Improvement and
share their improvement results and learning.
In between these sessions are “action periods,”
where the groups, supported by individual and
group coaching sessions led by QI experts, use
PDSA cycles to test improvements in their
facilities. For example, in Ghana, Project Fives
Alive! was implemented as a series of Collaboratives involving 134 hospitals. By 2014, collaborative participants had collectively achieved
a 31% decrease in under-five mortality and a
37% reduction in postneonatal infant mortality. As a result of the learning, a number of
new changes to maternal care were introduced
across many of the participating facilities, such
as early pregnancy identification and immediate postnatal care (Singh et al., 2016).
Quality Improvement Collaboratives
have also been successfully implemented to
improve the quality of home-based care delivered by community health workers in South
Africa, although the impact on quality of care
has been variable (Horwood et al., 2015).
Horwood and colleagues (2015) described
the successful adaptation and implementation of a Learning Collaborative in four QI
projects led by local teams and including
community-based health workers trained in
QI, often supported by facility-based staff. A
range of improvements were seen in targeted
areas, including effective spread of HIV treatment clubs to expand access to treatment in
South Africa. They emphasized the need for
initial and ongoing adaptation of the methods
to reflect local context and capacity, including simplifying data systems, adjusting QI
training methods, and motivation techniques

(see Chapter 14 for further discussion of Quality Improvement Collaboratives).

Lean Management Systems
The Lean paradigm, adapted from manufacturing, is based on the belief that improving a health
care system involves the reduction of waste in
the system (Joosten, Bongers, & Janssen, 2009).
(See Chapter 5 for a more detailed description
of Lean.) Lean approaches are often used to
improve the efficiency of nonclinical processes
such as registration, admission, or billing.
Although many of these processes may not have
a direct impact on patient outcomes, they can
improve patient experience and improve facility
throughput allowing greater number of patients
to be seen when the clinic is open.
One of the simplest and most often used
Lean tool is “5S” (standing for “sort, set in
order, shine, standardize, and sustain”), which
is a systematic approach to clean and organize
the workplace and is a common starting point
for more advanced Lean projects. 5S has been
used in facilities in Brazil, India, Jordan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Ghana, and Tanzania and has
been shown to produce improvements in efficiency (e.g., reduced turnaround time for procedures, or reduction in-patient waiting time),
safety (e.g., reduction in postsurgical infections), and patient centeredness (e.g., reduction
in time spent on activities other than patient
care) (Kanamori et al., 2016). The approach
has been adopted as part of national QI strategies in many of these countries. Lean principles were also applied in a hospital in Ghana
to improve the admissions process while educating the team about Lean principles (Carter
et al., 2012). Overall, the project successfully
engaged the team in identifying and working
to improve processes. There were also other
lessons learned that were important to adaption for further use in similar settings; these
included the recognition that implementation
required not just training, but, like most QI
work, leadership engagement; that tools varied in their feasibility and value; and that the

QI Frameworks and Methods

specific type of data required depended on the
stage of implementation.
Value chain mapping is another Lean
management tool that has also been effectively implemented in a nonprofit-run network of maternal health facilities to map care
and identify improvement projects, as well as
patient-centered value mapping to improve
pediatric HIV care in Togo, although scale-up
to national coverage of this approach has not
been described (Ramaswamy et al., 2017; Fiori
et al., 2016).

Six Sigma
The focus of the Six Sigma QI paradigm is on
eliminating defects and reducing variability
(Trusko et al., 2007). A defect is defined as an
outcome that does not meet the requirements
of its customers. Six Sigma–based approaches
have been used in Ghana as part of an integrated
improvement strategy that included clinical
skills strengthening, leadership development
and to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality
in tertiary hospitals (Ramaswamy et al., 2015).
The QI approach resulted in a 22.4% reduction
in maternal mortality from 2007 to 2011 at one
of the largest government hospitals in Ghana,
despite a 50% increase in deliveries and a significant increase in mothers admitted with obstetric complications (Srofenyoh et al., 2016). The
program was also shown to be highly cost effective (Goodman et al., 2017). Cost effectiveness
is another example of QI value and an important
component of the triple aim (Berwick, Nolan, &
Whittington, 2008) and more recently, the quadruple aim (Bodenheimer & Sinsky, 2014) of
health care described in Chapters 1 and 2.

Other Approaches to Improving
Care Delivery Quality in
Resource-Limited Settings
In addition to the process-focused QI methods described above, there is growing evidence
that mentoring or coaching, when done well
and integrated into supportive supervision,

303

can be an important component of improving provider competence to ensure the highest
quality of care (Magge et al., 2014; Lazzerini
et al., 2017). This has been seen in a range of
low- and middle-income settings, including
childhood care in Rwanda (Magge et al., 2014),
birth practices in India (Marx-Delaney et al.,
2017) and management of malaria in Uganda
(Mbonye et al., 2014). However, there is significant work needed to understand why it also
can be ineffective and how to ensure that individuals providing the supervision follow core
principles of supportive supervision and measure the effectiveness of the processes applied
(Oursler et al., 2011; Rowe et al., 2005; Leslie
et al., 2016). Given the system challenges in
many resource-limited settings, one approach
that has been recommended is integrating QI
coaching with clinical supervision, building
capacity for teams to address the systems gaps
during more traditional facility and provider
support (Mbonye et al., 2014). This approach
to coaching also can include working at district levels to build capacity to understand
and address higher levels gaps, which require
action and leadership at a national or subnational level. One relevant HIV example, is presented by viral load testing; if it is not being
done because there is inadequate capacity or
stock-out of reagents at the district level, then
systems strengthening from the top down is
needed, as well as coaching to providers around
the timing and performance of viral loads.
Another approach to improve quality
used in lower- (and higher-) resourced settings
is the use of checklists to improve adherence to
protocols (see Chapters 1, 4, and 8). The WHO
Safe Childbirth Checklist (SCC) was developed to help birth attendants deliver essential
birth practices known to prevent maternal and
neonatal harm (Spector et al., 2013). However,
as noted in Chapter 4, checklists are tools to be
used as part of a larger QI process, and their
use alone may not ensure improvement. For
example, the Better Birth Program integrated
a peer-coaching strategy to support consistent use of the SCC to improve the quality of

304

Chapter 13 Quality Improvement in Low- and Middle-Income Countries

facility-based delivery in resource-limited
settings. Implementation of the program in
a number of settings, including India and
Namibia, resulted in improvement in delivery
of these practices and, in Namibia, in selected
outcomes (Kabongo et al., 2017; MarxDelaney et al., 2017). Similar work has been
shown to be effective in improving the safety
and outcomes of surgical care across a range of
settings (Haynes et al. 2009).
Other interventions have included development of protocols and job aids for common
conditions, such as those that are leading causes
of childhood, maternal, and neonatal mortality; financial levers such as performance-based
financing; quality control; and broader system
strengthening (Gergen et al., 2017; Spector
et al., 2012; Bryce et al., 2005). These are not
within the scope of this chapter but are highly
recommended for further study.

Challenges and Proposed
Solutions to Scaling Up Effective
QI in Low- and Middle-Income
Settings
Despite the increase in QI work in recent
decades in many resource-constrained settings,
the evidence for short term impact and longer
term sustainability is variable (Schouten et al.,
2008; Franco & Marquez, 2011). There remain
a number of challenges at the national and local
levels in implementing effective QI programs.
These challenges do not suggest the need for
completely new QI approaches. Instead what
is needed is the adaptation of models that
have been successfully implemented in better resourced countries and increasingly in
resource-constrained settings to take into consideration the particular contexts, barriers, and
constraints of individual countries that prevent
delivery of quality care. In a recent review article, Heiby (2014) identified a number of challenges to implementing QI programs in Africa.
These include the following:

Focus on inputs and outcomes instead of on
processes. While the primary activities of
QI methods discussed are focused on making processes better, many health leaders
and donors still focus on strengthening the
inputs of the health care system and on measuring the resulting outcomes at the health
service level (coverage of targeted interventions), the population level (e.g., maternal and under-five mortality, rates of new
HIV infections). While inputs are clearly
important, large gaps in the performance
of systems have been observed even when
needed resources are present (Das et al.,
2012). For example, in Zambia, researchers found that even when no supplies were
needed to deliver quality care to children
with fever, the technical quality, defined as
following national guidelines for integrated
management of childhood illness, was still
not delivered (Lunze et al., 2017). A study
of delays in the interval between the decision to perform an emergency cesarean
section and when the baby was delivered
(the “decision-to-delivery interval” or DDI)
in a tertiary hospital in Ghana indicated a
median DDI of 195 minutes compared to
the 30-minute benchmark upheld by most
high-resource countries.
Challenges to measurement. Even when
greater attention is paid to processes,
measuring process quality is often not
easy and measuring outcomes valued
by customers such as experiential quality and motivation is even more difficult. These measures often require new
data collection methods, and the current
information systems in many low- and
middle-income countries do not provide
the necessary infrastructure for routine
data collection of needed indicators of
quality care (see Chapter 4). For example, measurement of provider competency (e.g., the extent to which providers
adhere to recognized protocols of care)
is critical but is not routinely captured.

QI Frameworks and Methods

Measurement can use a range of methods
including direct observation, chart review,
vignettes, patient interviews, simulations,
and standardized patients (Das et al.,
2012), but many of these are resource
intensive and are too complicated to collect, and no global recommendations exist
at the time of this publication in 2018.
These are also true for measures aligned
with Institute of Medicine dimensions,
such as timeliness (e.g., waiting time to
surgery once the need for an operation
has been established). In addition, there
is also a rising recognition that transforming care in low- and middle-income
countries should involve people-centered
health services able to meet the expectations and the needs of individuals and
their communities (Bitton et al., 2017; Srivastava et al., 2015; WHO, 2015). There
is therefore also a need to measure and
improve experiential quality in addition
to clinical and operational process measures to ensure the critical quality domain
of patient-centeredness. Work to improve
routine health management information
systems, identify core sets of indicators to
measure quality within and across countries beyond inputs, and the growth of
field-based mobile data collection systems
are promising trends that can improve the
quality and ease of collecting process data
(Pavluck et al., 2014; WHO, 2017a).
Lack of good guidance on how to implement
improvement solutions in a way that fits
the context of sites and regions. Even where
evidence exists on the evidence-based
interventions that can reduce morbidity
and mortality and potential solutions to
improve critical processes in health or
community systems, these are often challenging to implement and sustain. The
growing fields of implementation and
improvement science (Geng, Peiris, &
Kruk, 2017; Marshall, Pronovost, &
Dixon-Woods, 2013) offers the tools

305

and frameworks to address these challenges (see Chapter 3), but the field is
still emerging in low-resource settings.
There is a need for further research on
how models and frameworks of implementation science developed and used
in high-resource countries translate to
low-resource environments, how instruments to measure contexts and barriers and facilitators to implementation
apply in these environments and how
context-specific implementation guidance can be developed. The need for this
work is being recognized more widely, but
there is much work still needed to produce the actionable knowledge needed in
2018 and beyond (Ridde, 2016).
Limited documentation of implementation of QI in low-resource settings. Even
when effective implementation of QI
initiatives takes place, it is often hard
to find out what happened because of
the lack of available documentation.
The Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence (SQUIRE)
guidelines for documenting QI projects
were developed in 2008 and updated in
2016 to make them more applicable to
practitioners. But there is still a perception that these guidelines are primarily
meant for researchers who are publishing QI research and are not widely used
to document practice applications, even
in high-resource settings. Documentation of the everyday implementation
of QI programs at national, state, or
local levels—including how QI projects
were selected, standard methodologies
adapted for use, which stakeholders and
leaders were engaged in the process,
what changes were tested, and what challenges existed to implementation, scale,
and sustainability—are critical for building up a compendium of practice-based
evidence of how to make QI work in
resource-constrained environments.

306

Chapter 13 Quality Improvement in Low- and Middle-Income Countries

Lack of integration of QI into health worker
and public health training programs. QI
is not only a set of tools and methods;
as described in Chapter 1, it also encompasses a QI philosophy, which includes
many of the following concepts. Successful
QI practitioners have a problem-solving
mindset, a willingness to experiment and
learn from failure, a passion for bringing
about change in organizations and systems, and the ability to engage diverse
stakeholders with differing agendas and
priorities. The capacity and bandwidth of
health care workers, managers and leadership to translate data into action in general represents an ongoing challenge and
a need for changing how health workers
are trained. A government committed to
embedding QI into the health care system, needs to prioritize the development
of health care workers and managers to
be able to embed QI-trained professionals at all levels and the resources needed
to enable them to use these skills. Cadres include senior leaders who can act
as champions and drive systemic change
while establishing a learning organizational culture; QI professionals who can
guide teams through the technical components of the methodologies; front line staff
who can be part of QI teams and practice
every day, small-scale improvements;
and the broader community. Building
these capacities will require a number of
approaches: preservice training for health
care workers, experiential learning that
provides them the opportunity to practice
and hone their skills, advanced training
for improvement coaches, and on-the-job
training for leaders and front-line staff.
Multilevel training efforts in Kenya and
Ghana have been shown to be effective but
these programs are rare and have not scaled
up to national coverage (Ramaswamy
et al., 2015). As online training becomes
routine, there is now a possibility to train a
larger number of practitioners worldwide,

but building deep QI capability will still
initially require coaches on the ground
to help translate new theory to meaningful context-relevant practice and this still
remains a challenge.
Lack of integration of QI into broader health
system strengthening activities. In many
resource-limited settings, the challenges
faced in implementing QI are no different
from the challenges faced by the system in
delivering quality services. For example,
the weak information systems that make it
difficult to collect process data for QI also
make it difficult to collect data needed for
patient care and effective management.
Focusing on strengthening systems for
QI alone without integrating with broader
health systems strengthening work is
unlikely to lead to successful sustainable
results. Similarly, health systems strengthening that solely focuses on improving
inputs and coverage without measuring
and improving quality will also fail to provide the population health gains needed.
Lack of an overall national strategy that
ensures learning from and overall coordination of QI to achieve national scale-up of QI.
Ultimately, the effectiveness of a national
QI program depends on national leadership and a policy and strategy that provides
both top-down direction and resources
and the ability to innovate and learn from
the more local work. This approach is
needed to ensure that local improvements
that offer promise for broader impact are
understood to inform potential scale and
work needed to sustain these improvements over time, while ensuring that local
efforts reflect national and subnational
priorities. Rwanda is an unusual example of a country that has established a
culture of quality and learning led by
national and local leadership, which has
resulted in broadly improved health outcomes (Farmer et al., 2013). In response
to the challenges faced by other countries,

the WHO recently produced a roadmap
for countries to develop these strategies
(WHO, 2017b), but this can still be a tough
balance to strike. If the projects are not relevant to local staff, then it may be difficult
to get buy in. On the other hand, if local
priorities are not linked to national strategies and policies, QI teams may spend
time and resources on “feel-good projects”
that do not bring about changes in critical
outcomes. Similarly, some change requires
higher level resources and direction to
address longer term changes needed to
ensure quality such as reorganization of
models of care, reform of preservice training and changes in health care funding.
The WHO has been working to develop
guidance for national governments to demonstrate how to develop these policies and strategies and other organizations have already been
supporting country-led work in a number of
low-resource settings (WHO, 2017b). National
deployment of any approach will require multilevel capacity building, which, in the absence
of commitment of resources from within
the country and from partners, is difficult to
carry out. Taking lessons from the successes
and failures of national quality strategies from
high-resource countries and growing work in
lower-resourced countries will inform how
countries can be more effective in integrating
quality and QI into national policies and strategies and improving quality and generate the
knowledge needed to accelerate the work within
their own borders, the region, and globally.

Conclusions

There has been an exciting increase in the
focus on quality as core to achieving better and more equitable population health,
more efficiently, effectively, and being more
responsive to the needs and goals of the communities served. There is a clear recognition
that QI methods targeting process changes
at the local level are a critical part of the
toolkit that resource-limited countries need
to facilitate change at the community, facility, and local levels. This can be achieved by
adapting lessons learned in higher resourced
settings and increasingly from other lower
resourced settings. However, this processfocused QI work must be integrated into
top-down national level policies and strategies articulating priorities, targeting broader
system change and ensuring resources and
leadership needed to ensure sustainability of
change, resilience of the health system and
ultimately meet the ends and goals of their
citizens. Only through better understanding gained from integrated research can the
global community work and learn together
to achieve the important goals of quality care
that are effective and affordable for all.

CHAPTER 14

Future Trends and Challenges
for Continuous Quality
Improvement in Health Care
Julie K. Johnson and William A. Sollecito
Every system is perfectly designed to get the
results it gets.
—Paul Batalden

B

oth the philosophy and processes
of continuous quality improvement
(CQI) in health care have continued
to evolve since the publication of our last
edition in 2013. This evolution spans geographical bounds, with ever-widening applications in developing countries; as described
in Chapter 13. It also spans health sectors,
with probably the best example being the
institutionalization of CQI in public health
(described in Chapter 11) spurred by external
forces such as accreditation (see Chapter 12),
as well as internal forces, primarily leadership
and cultural influences, encouraging improvement of population health in the most efficient
manner. Recent trends in the evolution of CQI
have also included broader and more accessible sources of data to carry out CQI, although

these are not without some risks, as described
in Chapter 4.
Despite the continuing expansion and
evolution of CQI in health care, many of the
same challenges to quality care and patient
safety still persist. These trends are not unlike
those that have been seen in other industries
and they will not be changed without careful
attention to what we have learned in the past
coupled with a shared vision across all health
care sectors of what we hope to achieve in the
future. This leads us to a series of important
questions that we can ask here, with answers

health care settings? How do we motivate
health professionals to engage in improvement
activities? How do we put a greater emphasis
on adding value as we implement CQI initiatives? Who are the future leaders, where do
we find them, and how can we support their
development? While to a large extent the
future is uncertain, definite trends are under
way that we believe will be important themes
for the future of CQI. The aim of this chapter
is to discuss some of those trends and future
challenges, and to create a road map for those
who will be leading the transformation of
health care.

▸

Setting the Stage
for CQI

In patient care settings, we operationalize CQI
by asking two separate, but related, questions:
1.
2.

How can I improve care for my
patients?
How can I improve the system
of care?

It is generally agreed that the systems we
work within are at the root of many of our
patient safety and quality problems (IOM,
1999). Quality and safety are both properties of systems, and many of our quality and
safety initiatives—the specific changes we put
into place to make improvements—belong
to the system. Many of these initiatives are
described in the recent CQI literature, but not
all, since some that have not been successful
have suffered the fate of publication bias; that
is, they aren’t published in peer-reviewed
publications and thus are not disseminated,
despite their usefulness as mechanisms for
learning how to improve our improvement
strategies. Many of these initiatives have
cross-disciplinary applications, which have
been addressed in the preceding chapters,
and together these initiatives create a road
map for those who wish to lead the future
transformation of health care.

The translation of research into practice requires a certain set of skills; similarly, health care professionals will need to
be proficient in specialized skills to be able
to translate quality improvement concepts
into sustained improvements in patient care
processes and health outcomes. System-level
results do not come from a single initiative
or even a series of initiatives when these
efforts are not aligned. System improvements
require a portfolio of projects that are aligned
with strategy to produce and sustain results
(Nolan, 2007).

Conceptual
Frameworks for
Improving Care

Health care has been described as a complex
adaptive system (Rouse, 2008; Swensen et al.,
2010), and much has been written about both
the system itself and solutions that target various levels of the system, so it is not a lack of
evidence about system solutions that is holding us back.
FIGURE 14.1 illustrates three fundamental
aims of a health system: better patient outcomes, better system performance, and better
professional development. A fourth necessary component is the active engagement of

Conceptual Frameworks for Improving Care

everyone in the health system toward helping
to achieve those fundamental aims (Batalden
& Davidoff, 2007; Nelson et al., 2008).
We can compare Figure 14.1 to a similar framework, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Triple Aim, which
includes improving the patient experience
of care, improving the health of populations,
and reducing the per capita cost of health
care. (Berwick, Nolan, & Whittington, 2008,
p. 759). The primary drivers that will make it
possible to simultaneously optimize all three
aims in the United States are:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Measurement that is transparent
Public health interventions
Design and coordination of care at
the patient level
Universal access to care
A financial management system

A further expansion of these concepts,
which recognizes the role of health care providers, adds a fourth aim: improving the work
life experience of health care providers, with
the specific goals of decreasing burnout, which
has been widely reported in recent years, and
increasing the intrinsic motivation of providers,
a key factor related to the successful implementation of CQI (Deming, 1986). The application
of what is now being called the Quadruple Aim,
while still a fairly new concept, is expected to
have a major impact on achieving the vision of
improved safety and quality of care, for individuals and populations (Bodenheimer & Sinsky,
2014; Sikka, Morath, & Leape, 2015).
Derek Feeley, the CEO of the IHI, points
out that several institutions have decided
to adopt the Quadruple Aim to focus on an
additional goal that aligns with their specific
organizational vision. He offers some important thoughts on the complementary nature of
the Triple and Quadruple Aim with advice for
how to incorporate both into a quality health
care strategy (Feeley, 2018):
1.

Remember that the Triple Aim is
about patients. Patients are always
at the center of what we do.

2.

3.

4.

313

We haven’t finished pursuing the
original Triple Aim. There are still
gaps in the health of the populations that we serve. We miss too
many opportunities to improve the
care experience. We haven’t done
enough to improve health care
quality while reducing costs.
Don’t lose focus. No organization
has unlimited resources, so we
must deploy what we have in an
intentional, purposeful way.
Measure what matters. Use deliberation and consideration to determine what data you really need,
and how to collect and analyze it.

This focus on the individual person is an
important reminder for those who wish to
lead the future improvement of health care
and is highlighted by Don Berwick in A User’s
Manual for the IOM’s Quality Chasm Report
(Berwick, 2002), in which he suggests that
there are four levels of interest:
■
■
■

■

Level A: The experience of patients
(individuals)
Level B: The functioning of small units of
care delivery (or microsystems)
Level C: The functioning of the organizations that house or otherwise support
microsystems
Level D: The environment of policy, payment, regulation, accreditation, and other
such factors that shape the behavior, interests, and opportunities of the organizations at Level C

“True north,” Berwick writes, “lies at
Level A: patients [individuals] and their experiences” (Berwick, 2002). The fourth aim of the
Quadruple Aim also plays a critical role, albeit
at Levels B and C in Berwick’s model.
Note that the Triple Aim (improving the
experience of care, improving the health of
populations, and reducing per capita costs of
health care) is slightly different from the fundamental aims shown in Figure 14.1 (better
patient outcomes, better system performance,

314

Chapter 14 Future Trends and Challenges for Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care

and better professional development). While
these aims are not in conflict, better professional development is a key difference in the
two models, which aligns very closely with the
fourth part of the Quadruple Aim. Educating
professionals (including staff) is a critical part
of the fourth aim. As described by Bodenheimer and Sinsky (2014), greater training for
health care professionals is positive motivation
and also a way to foster empowerment. We
believe that this aim is necessary in achieving
the other aims, and a more detailed discussion
about educating professionals to lead quality
improvement is presented later in this chapter.

For CQI to add value, have impact, and
realize its potential, it will need to be managed
at multiple levels. An ecological perspective
provides a potential framework for thinking
about CQI, because it acknowledges many
contextual layers, such as the environment,
organization, health care provider, family, and
individual patient characteristics, that directly
or indirectly influence a range of patient care
outcomes. It also provides a model for breaking down the complexity into manageable
components and identifying linkages and
interdependencies that must be considered
when making changes. FIGURE 14.2 illustrates

the ecological perspective in public health; it
encompasses the vision that is the critical step
in developing constancy of purpose (Deming,
1986) and ultimately developing a culture
that embraces improvement (see Chapter 2).
The model shown in Figure 14.2 was
developed by the public health profession,
which has made great strides in quality
improvement (see Chapter 11), spanning education and practice, in recent years and provides another model for accelerating CQI in
health care. Much of that progress was initiated
with the release of a 2003 Institute of Medicine
(IOM) report that “reviews the nation’s public health capabilities and presents a comprehensive framework for how the government
public health agencies, working with multiple partners from the public and private sectors as an intersectoral public health system,
can better assure the health of communities”
(IOM, 2003). The extension of this model to
other sectors of health requires a conversion of
terms, but not concepts; it is another example
of cross-disciplinary thinking and interprofessional sharing of ideas.

Road Map for the

Every journey begins with a single step.
—Chinese proverb
Future trends and challenges related to accelerating CQI in health care, are discussed in the
following sections; these are organized into the
following sections:
■
■
■
■
■

Education (CQI skills, leadership, teamwork, and collaboration)
Quality improvement collaboratives (QIC)
Learning organizations (health systems)
Value-added health care
Research and publication

These topics are not listed in order of
importance but, taken together, are points of

315

emphasis or priorities for those of us in health
care that constitute a starting point for where
to go next to ensure a greater focus in the
near future on efficient applications of CQI
and related concepts such as the Quadruple
Aim. These were chosen in part because they
are multidisciplinary, and applicable to broad
range of health sectors, but are by no means
exhaustive.

Education: CQI Skills, Leadership,
Teamwork, and Collaboration
We believe that education is the first, and
perhaps the most important, step toward
accelerating CQI in health care. During the
past decade, we have seen an increased focus
on educating health professions students to
improve the systems they are training to work
within by teaching CQI skills and techniques.
This has been seen across the continuum of
medical education, from students in medical
schools to postgraduate residency training programs to initial board certification and maintenance of certification programs. However,
further formal efforts are needed—learning
from and building upon successful models.
The Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth
has documented its success in incorporating
quality improvement into its education using
an experiential approach (Adams, 2010); it
provides a good model for others to study,
including emphasis on the importance of careful evaluation to ensure successful curricular
reform (Ogrinc et al., 2011).
While medical education has been criticized because it has not traditionally prepared
physicians to work as part of teams, we have
seen more efforts to train health professionals
to work as part of a team or “microsystem.”
We have also witnessed an increased focus
on quality improvement in public health and
nursing education. The Quality and Safety
Education for Nurses (QSEN) approach serves
as a model for consensus building and, spanning 15 nursing schools, is also an example of
how to implement broad levels of change on a

316

Chapter 14 Future Trends and Challenges for Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care

national scale (Sherwood and Jones, 2013). It
provides for education of students and faculty
on the skills needed to practice. (Additional
information is available at the website for the
QSEN Institute of the Frances Payne Bolton
School of Nursing at Case Western Reserve
University.) As noted earlier, broader education for staff, nurses, and physicians is an
important part of the Quadruple Aim (Bodenheimer & Sinsky, 2014).
One criticism of educational approaches
for CQI in medical care is that clinicians,
especially physicians, were brought along
later, or not at all—sometimes because they
were thought to be too busy with the work
of caring for patients. Not only did this lead
to slow diffusion of CQI in health care, but it
sometimes led to frustration or even a sense
of failure from frontline clinicians (Ofri, 2010)
that could perpetuate a resistance to CQI initiatives (Balestracci, 2009). It is clear now that
physicians should be included early on, and
their ideas and concerns should be addressed
as part of the education process (Berwick &
Nolan, 1998). As noted by Solberg and colleagues (2006, p. 298):
The net result of all of these changes
has been to focus attention and pressure on clinicians, especially those
in primary care. They are feeling
both stressed and unappreciated,
as they have to run faster to keep
up while being constantly told that
what they do isn’t good enough. At
the same time, it is becoming clearer
that if we are to address the cost and
quality conundrums we face, clinicians must not only be involved,
they must take the lead in making
change happen.
In addition to specific CQI skills, there is
a need to focus educational efforts on broader
areas of leadership and teamwork. They are
critical competencies associated with quality improvement and are part of the critical

“non-technical skills” (Flin et al., 2008) that
will better prepare health care practitioners to
shape the quality and safety of health care in
the future. As depicted in FIGURE 14.3, leadership, teamwork, and CQI skills are the overlapping, complementary foundations of an
educational process needed to develop future
health care quality improvement leaders.
Within those disciplines are specific skill sets
that are beneficial to health care in general and
CQI specifically.
For everyone to be actively engaged in
doing their work and improving their work,
there is a basic assumption that everyone will
develop a basic understanding of the standards of their own work, as well as the quality
improvement skills they need to test changes
in that work (Batalden & Davidoff, 2007). As
we develop educational programs, an additional consideration for education is that there
is a concurrent need to ensure that faculties
are both knowledgeable and experienced in
the techniques required to implement CQI
broadly. It is critical that practitioners learn
what to do to improve quality and also become
experienced in how it can be done most effectively, using appropriate implementation science techniques to be discussed further later in
this chapter. This is described in management
science as overcoming the knowing–doing
gap (Pfeffer & Sutton, 2000). It is a gap that

CQI skills

FIGURE 14.3 Educational Components for Future

Road Map for the Future

has stalled some very well-intentioned CQI
initiatives.
One key to process improvement, which
also illustrates overcoming the knowing–
doing gap, is statistical thinking. Training in
the quantitative sciences is necessary, but not
sufficient; statistical thinking must be woven
into the culture for all to understand its role
in decision making—especially decision making about changes and improvements. In an
organization or culture that is dedicated to
CQI, “statistical thinking means looking at
everything the organization does as a series
of processes that have the goal of consistently
providing the results your customer desires”
(Balestracci, 2009, p. 85). The basics of statistical thinking start with measurement and the
ability to learn from the data we have collected
(see Chapter 4). We must then take the time
to understand what the data tell us, particularly about causes of variation (Deming, 1986),
before taking action to make changes. This is a
central principle of the application of the Plan,
Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycle.

Leadership
The role of leadership is recognized as fundamental to improving quality and safety because
leaders enable connections between the aims
(see Figure 14.1 and the preceding discussion
of the Quadruple Aim) and the design and
testing of those improvements. Leadership has
a critical role in setting a vision for change,
or constancy of purpose (Deming, 1986) and
shaping a culture that embraces quality and
safety. Leadership is the first of seven Health
Care Criteria for Performance Excellence for
the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.
According to the Baldrige National Quality
Program (2011, p. 49):
An organization’s senior leaders
(administrative and health care provider leaders) should set directions
and create a patient focus, clear and
visible values, and high expectations.

317

. . . Leaders should ensure the creation
of strategies, systems, and methods
for achieving excellence in health
care, stimulating innovation, and
building knowledge and capabilities.
Leading an organization that is committed to improving quality and adding value
requires creating a “learning organization”
that learns from within and formally seeks
new ideas from outside as well, which are
keys to the diffusion of CQI in health care
(Berwick, 2003).
Leadership is not about applying a collection of tools and techniques to those being
led; it involves integrating the learning disciplines throughout the organization—vision,
values, and purpose; systems thinking; and
mental models (Senge, 1990). Successful leaders motivate followers to contribute to the
development of a shared vision, that emphasizes the values of CQI, and demonstrate their
personal commitment to achieving it. They
“inspire” the vision throughout the organization. When defining leadership in the terms of
creating a learning organization, the role of the
leader is to take responsibility for learning, as
a designer of the learning process, a steward of
the vision, and a teacher by fostering the learning throughout the organization (Senge, 1990).
In so doing, leaders ensure the development
of an organizational culture that embraces
change and improvement.
Leadership includes not only defining the
vision but also living that vision and leading by
example. Also important to note is that leadership must occur at all levels within an organization, including scientific leaders, opinion
leaders, and those who champion change ideas
(Greenhalgh et al., 2005). These individuals
may or may not have administrative leadership roles. As discussed earlier, education
and training are the critical factors to ensure
leadership in the future—and not merely for
those at the top levels of an organization.
If we want to establish leaders at all levels,
then we need leadership training at all levels.

318

Chapter 14 Future Trends and Challenges for Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care

Leadership education is no longer confined
to business schools, but is being expanded to
the sciences, including medicine, nursing, and
public health. This is a trend that must continue. There has also been greater availability
of leadership publications that are directed at
the unique leadership challenges faced in academic medicine (Houpt, Gilkey, & Ehringhaus,
2015; Viera & Kramer, 2016). Similarly, leadership programs and literature have expanded
among other health disciplines that are directly
involved in CQI, for example Biostatisticians
(LaVange et al., 2012). These are only samples
of broader initiatives that need to be replicated
to encourage greater leadership development
among a wide array of health professionals.
Leadership skills should not be limited to
those that are specific to health care challenges
but should emphasize those aspects of leadership that are most appropriate for leaders of
CQI initiatives in health; for example, an
emphasis on transformational leadership and
the related broader topic of leading change
(Daft, 2015; Kotter, 1996; Rowitz, 2009;
Sapienza, 2004). Educational programs should
address the predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors that lead to higher quality, safer
health care, for example, organizational dynamics and diffusion of innovation, and establishing a vision and culture to embrace change.

Teamwork
Closely associated with the role of leadership is
the need for teamwork, which is central to CQI
initiatives, but is under-represented in health
care curriculums. Teamwork, especially in
modern health care, is no longer an option but
a requirement. Characterized by distribution
of responsibilities and leadership at all levels,
the use of teams adds value, and improves
efficiency, by driving decisions to their lowest
competent level. Empowerment of team members and high levels of individual motivation
that result are also important in ensuring the
development of a culture that is devoted to
safety and quality (Daft, 2015; Grove, 1995).

The role of teams in CQI has long been recognized (Deming, 1986); coupled with technology to communicate more effectively,
teams are even more important and easier to
organize and lead than in earlier years, with
more well-defined and well-tested team building and leadership procedures (Daft, 2015;
Grove, 1995). However, like many other factors associated with health care CQI, there is
an important need to teach practitioners how
to be effective members of health care teams,
especially CQI teams. (See Chapter 6 for an
extensive discussion of health care teams and
especially their role in CQI.)

Collaboration
The ability to collaborate, or work across
departments, divisions or institutions to
improve quality and safety is a clear direction
for the future and an important leadership and
teamwork skill; it is also described in some
leadership textbooks as, boundary spanning
leadership (Ernst & Chrobot-Mason, 2010).
Improving value can be accomplished through
effective collaborations, including acceptance of
shared goals among all stakeholders, measurement of process and outcomes, and sharing of
best practices. Indeed, outcome improvements
and meaningful cost reductions are unachievable without active cooperation among providers committed to functioning as synergistic
units. Collaboration is also critical in successful navigation of multidisciplinary efforts that
are central to many CQI efforts; collaboration
may require spanning departmental boundaries within a health organization or may involve
spanning multiple organizations. While collaboration is a particular skill that can be taught,
practiced, and refined, Quality Improvement
Collaboratives (QICs) are an organizing structure for multiorganizational collaboration
that exemplifies the evolution of CQI methods across geographic boundaries and areas of
health care. As described in the following sections, QICs are particularly important in both
the history and the future of CQI in health care.

Road Map for the Future

Quality Improvement
Collaboratives
QICs, also known as Learning Collaboratives,
are an example of a broad-based approach
with applications that range from primary care
to public health. Although some have argued
that clear evidence of their effectiveness, in
terms of improved outcomes, is lacking, their
widespread adoption is well documented
(Schouten et al., 2008). QIC implementation
requires and ensures practice-based-learning
of several skills that are necessary components of successful CQI applications, including teamwork, leadership, and collaboration.
Their continued use will be a strong positive
force contributing to the spread of CQI in
the future. QICs consist of “multidisciplinary
teams from various health care departments
or organizations that join forces for several
months to work in a structured way to improve
their provision of care” (Schouten et al., 2008,
p. 1491). They have been described as temporary learning organizations. (Ovretveit et al.,
2002). Greenhalgh et al., (2005), in their comprehensive review of the literature on diffusion
of innovation in health service organizations,
describe the goal of QICs as “spread of ideas”:
Participants in a quality collaborative work together over a number of
months, sharing ideas and knowledge,
setting specific goals, measuring progress, sharing techniques for organizational change and implementing
rapid-cycle, iterative tests of change.
Learning sessions are the major
events of a Collaborative; these are
2-day events where members of the
multi-disciplinary project teams from
each health care organization gather
to share experiences and learn from
clinical and change experts and their
colleagues. The time between learning
sessions is called an action period in
which participants work within their
own organizations towards major,

319

“breakthrough” improvement, focusing on their internal organizational
agenda and priorities for changes
and improvements whilst remaining in continuous contact with other
Collaborative participants. (p.163)
Introduced initially in the United States
in the mid-1980s, QICs are now used in many
countries with varying health care financing
systems, including Canada, Australia, and
European countries, where several national
health authorities support nationwide quality
programs based on this strategy. One of the first
uses of QICs was The Northern New England
Cardiovascular Disease Study Group in 1986. A
similar approach has been used in the United
Kingdom through its National Health Service
Modernization Agency; it is called the Beacon
Model and focuses on transfer of best practices,
derived from Beacon organizations “that have
achieved a high standard of service delivery and
are regarded as centers of best practice” (Greenhalgh et al., 2005, p. 168). Recently, QICs have
also been successful in low- and middle-income
countries (see Chapter 13).
QICs were initially developed and are
still used in primary care; for example, see
Solberg’s description of the DIAMOND QIC,
which has a goal of improving care and outcomes for adult patients with depression in
primary care clinics (2013). They have now
evolved to a broader number of settings, and
their widespread adoption in the United States
has led to the formation of a national organization, the Network for Regional Healthcare
Improvement (Network for Regional Healthcare Improvement, 2018).
QICs have become particularly prevalent
in surgical care, especially at the state level
(Dellinger et al., 2005; Campbell et al., 2009;
Guillamondegui et al., 2012; SCOAP Collaborative et al., 2012). A recent example of a
large scale surgical QIC is the Illinois Surgical
Quality Improvement Collaborative (ISQIC),
which was developed in late 2014. ISQIC
is a payer-funded initiative and includes

320

Chapter 14 Future Trends and Challenges for Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care

57 diverse Illinois hospitals that agreed to
adopt the widely recognized American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical
Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP)
as the common data sharing platform. In
addition, ISQIC includes 21 components,
organized into five domains, to facilitate
quality improvement that target the hospital, the surgical QI team, and the perioperative microsystem: guided implementation
(e.g., mentors, coaches, statewide QI projects), education (e.g., process improvement
curriculum), hospital- and surgeon-level
comparative performance reports (e.g., process, outcomes, costs), networking (e.g.,
forums to share QI experiences and best
practices), and funding (e.g., for the overall
program, pilot grants, and bonus payments
for improvement) (Nadeem et al., 2013;
Nembhard, 2009; Hall, Hamilton et al., 2009;
Hall, Richards, Ingraham, & Ko, 2009).
There are many other examples of successful QICs in CQI (de Vries et al., 2010; Haynes
et al., 2009), such as the National Cancer Institute’s Community Clinical Oncology Program
(Minasian et al., 2010) and the National Community Cancer Centers Program (Clauser et al.,
2009; Johnson et al., 2011) developed to provide
access to state-of-the-art cancer care in community settings. An exciting example of the future
of collaboratives can be seen with the Collaborative Improvement and Innovation Networks
(CoIINs), which are multidisciplinary teams
of federal, state, and local leaders working
together to tackle a common problem. Using
technology to remove geographic barriers, participants with a collective vision share ideas,
best practices, and lessons learned, and track
their progress toward similar benchmarks and
shared goals. CoIIN provides a way for participants to self-organize, forge partnerships, and
take coordinated action to address complex
issues through structured collaborative learning, quality improvement, and innovative activities (HRSA, 2018).
The success and widespread adoption
of QICs are directly related to the exchange

and application of best practices by experts
and peers to carry out improvement initiatives. Referring to the work of Ovretveit et al.
(2002), the reasons for the success of QICs can
be grouped into four general categories: topics
chosen for improvement, participant and team
characteristics, skills of facilitator and expert
advisers, and ensuring ways to maximize
spread of ideas. Greenhalgh et al. (2005, p. 167)
explain that these success factors result from:
1.

2.

3.

4.

5.

Clearly focused important topics
that address clear gaps between
current and best practice.
Highly motivated participants who
clearly understand individual and
corporate goals in a supportive
organizational culture.
Effective teams and team leadership whose goals are in alignment
with those of the organization.
Facilitation by credible experts, who
provide adequate support outside as
well as through the learning events.
Maximizing the spread of ideas
through networking between teams
and other mechanisms.

Based on their systematic review of the
literature, these authors conclude that QICs
have been demonstrated to be successful and
popular ways of implementing improvements
in health service delivery. However, they also
point out two major criticisms—they are
expensive, and gains from them have been
difficult to measure. Indeed, creating and
maintaining a collaborative is resource intensive, requiring significant financial and labor
support. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate the
most effective way to learn and engage front
line clinicians in the QIC process.
This key point about engaging frontline clinicians in the QIC process cannot be
over-emphasized and is an underlying factor
that helps explain the attraction and success
of using QICs in health care. For example,
this principle is also noted in a description
of the success of the Michigan ICU program

Road Map for the Future

for decreasing central venous catheter bloodstream infections (CVC-BSIs). Dixon-Woods
and colleagues provide an in-depth analysis of the success of this program, including
the fact that in addition to being founded on
evidence-based, consensus driven interventions and other well defined scientific factors,
it also succeeded because of evidence drawn
from social science about physician behavior
(Dixon-Woods et al., 2011, p. 186):
Clinicians’ behavior is not only influenced by abstract knowledge and
formal bodies of evidence but also by
trusted peers … people are more likely
to change their behaviors when they
see liked and trusted peers doing the
same … Critical to the Michigan’s ability to create a professional community
focused on reducing CVC-BSIs and to
secure legitimacy within the community was its use of leaders who were
ICU “insiders” with whom members
of the community could identify.
This is an important factor that must be
emphasized on its own, to help define the road
map for the future success of CQI in health

321

care, and it is also an underlying feature of
QICs that help to guarantee their continued
role in that future.

Learning Organizations (Health
Systems)
To succeed in a rapidly changing environment,
including improving quality and safety in
the future, health care organizations/systems
need to smoothly manage the transformation
process and take on the challenge of becoming what Peter Senge (1990, p. 3) described as
“learning organizations,” places where “people
continually expand their capacity to create the
results they truly desire, where new and expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured, where
collective aspiration is set free and where people are continually learning to learn together.”
As presented in TABLE 14.1, health care has
experienced and must continue to strive for
a process of transitioning from a professional
model characterized by individual responsibility, professional autonomy, and accountability to a transformational model characterized
by shared responsibility and collaborative
decision making, continuous innovation, and

learning (Upshaw, Steffen, and McLaughlin
2013). Traditional CQI provides important
skills needed to make the transition, but transformational models provide organizations the
opportunity to ensure that both incremental
and radical learning occur in order to meet
the challenges of an uncertain and complex
environment. Through organizational learning, health care organizations can better
face the reality of managing costs, providing
high-quality services, and improving outcomes while accommodating individual needs
through case management, patient education,
and support of patient decision making.
Table 14.1 presents the following distinguishing characteristics of the transformational model that are fundamental to CQI.

Shared and Individual
Responsibility by Leaders
and Employees
Operating under transformational models,
health care managers and clinical leaders share
responsibility for accomplishing the organizational mission with other personnel. Everyone
understands that they are important to the
success of the organization, and they know
what role they play in that success. Individuals,
teams, units, and departments are committed
to carrying out their responsibilities.

Leadership by People
at Multiple Levels
Leadership roles for making decisions and
guiding change must be afforded to people
working in managerial or clinical roles, line
staff, and field positions. Changes and decisions
designed by people in offices apart from where
the work is performed usually have limited
effect. Their role should be limited to determining and communicating the broader environmental context in which local decision making
takes place. For real innovation and improved
performance, people working directly with

problems and systems need to be empowered
to be fully involved in designing and deciding
how to improve processes and quality. These
are the people on the sharp end of processes,
who will experience intrinsic motivation to lead
the transformations that are needed, including
innovation and improvement.

Outcome- and Value-Driven
Process
People throughout transformative health
care organizations demonstrate commitment
to achieving outcomes, improving quality,
and adding value. Employees, providers, and
managers recognize that improving outcomes
means that individual expectations for quality
and clinical services, such as disease treatment
and management, meet and exceed standards.

Shared Decision Making
It is critically important that people understand the core business, values, and mission
of the organization so that they can participate
in the decisions that affect them. Straight talk
about what is occurring in the environment,
how the organization is positioned to respond,
and what people need to do to make necessary
changes must be modeled and supported by
managers and leaders. People need to understand their roles in helping the organization
succeed, but they also need to define their
roles and how they will contribute.

Continuous Planning
People must be motivated to make change
and able to participate meaningfully in the
change process. In general, participation will
be more effective when the issues and changes
are not routine (Schwarz, 1989). Transformational change in organizations prepares people to participate in planning and anticipating
next steps in an evolutionary change process.
When the organization is undergoing regular
and dynamic change, people from across the

Road Map for the Future

organization must be informed and involved
in deciding what changes should be made, in
what order, and by what methods. Through
functional and cross-functional teams, providers and managers can involve others in
mapping strategies and preparing for new
challenges (Carroll & Edmondson, 2002).

Future Orientation
Unlike what has come before, health care organizations and systems must be defining what
the future will be and setting their sights on
how they will make that happen. A potential
danger for the transformative organization
is that it might achieve its objectives for the
immediate future and turn its attention to categorizing its accomplishments. Such a retrospective orientation will slow the organization
and reduce people’s motivation to stay ahead
of the trends in the ever-changing health care
sector. Transformational leadership continually brings forward the vision of the future
organization and indicates how the organization can get from where it is in the present to
where it wants to be in the future.

Performance Enhancement
Appraisals
In addition to rewarding and assessing performance improvements for individual employees and teams, transformational organizations
need to commit real resources and support
structures to recognizing creativity and innovation. We need to look beyond improving
how we get things done and begin to question
and explore new ways of doing what needs to
be done. Employees need to know that they
will be rewarded for going outside the traditional structures to redesign and recreate the
organization. Such changes will improve more
than employee performance; they will increase
employee dedication and contributions to the
organization’s future success. Commitment is
greater in organizations that are actively managing change, obviously uncomfortable with

323

the status quo, and creating a new standard for
performance (McNeese-Smith, 1996; Pascale
et al., 1997).
Some of that uneasiness could be mitigated
by training staff to understand that health care
has two types of processes side by side, ranging from evidence-based to discovery (Bohmer
2009) and exhibiting a continuum of complexity
and uncertainty (Green et al., 2001).

Continuous Innovation
To excel in the future, health care organizations will need to establish systems that reward
people for good work to recognize efforts that
surpass expectations. Transformative models
provide support for people to demonstrate
creativity and innovation that extend beyond
standard performance. Clear systems for highlighting outstanding performance and contributions of providers, administrators, and
employees can energize others and provide
standards against which to assess poor performance (Pascale et al., 1997).

A Focus on Value-Added
Health Care
Clearly a trend that must continue is the focus
on improving the “value” of the health care service contribution to better health. Value, as a
framework for efficiently improving outcomes,
is a concept that all stakeholders—patients,
providers, payers, and policy makers—can
embrace (Lee, 2010). This is critical for all
health care systems, including those in lowand middle-income countries since they are
dealing with limited resources for access and
services as well as for CQI initiatives. But how
is value achieved? Value has been defined as “a
function of three elements: its design (the right
treatment for the right patient at the right time),
its execution (reliably doing it right every time
to achieve the best outcomes), and its cost over
time” (Swensen et al., 2010). More simply, value
can be defined as “health outcome achieved
per dollar spent” (Porter, 2010). This definition

324

Chapter 14 Future Trends and Challenges for Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care

implies that value is created around the patient,
for the patient (Porter, 2010). If value improves,
patients, payers, providers, and suppliers all
benefit since the economic sustainability of the
health care system increases.
The CQI evolution has emphasized many
fundamental concepts of health improvement
and change including health care services as a
system and process; system leadership; measurement of outcome; unwanted variation; system failure and unreliability; organization-wide
contributions to better health; making improvement part of everyone’s job; and accountability
for better performance. To some extent we have
de-emphasized the focus on value. Moving forward, value has reemerged as a key concept for
the future of healthcare and its roots go back
many years to Philip Crosby (Crosby, 1980) and
others. Crosby does not talk about the business
case for quality, but his idea that “quality is free”
is at the heart of this concept, in that the cost of
poor quality is the expense of not doing things
correctly the first time, which directly relates
to the value proposition; the costs of a quality
program are more than offset by the value produced, and avoidance of costs of rework and the
loss of customers as well (Crosby, 1980).
Clinicians and patients coproduce health
care services. Good health outcomes, experience, and value are created by bringing the
right people together with the right information, the right technology, in the right
way, and at the right time, in response to a
patient’s needs (Batalden, 2016). The conversation about value needs to address value to
patients, internal customers, and suppliers,
as well as the overall population. The focus
on internal as well as external customers has
been discussed for many years as a basic tenet
of CQI (Crosby, 1980; Deming, 1986) and is
also consistent with the new thinking on provider well-being that is incorporated in the
Quadruple Aim. Individual physicians are not
necessarily compelled to change when faced
with data on their own patients; data must be
given with the context of an organizational
culture that is dedicated to quality and safety,

as illustrated by the Intermountain Healthcare
example (Savitz, 2012). Fjeldstadt suggests
a “value model,” which is an organizational
architecture for health care service that builds
on three complementary and interdependent
value-creating building blocks: the value shop,
the value chain, and the value network (Stabell
& Fjeldstad, 1998). The value shop has been the
predominant way of creating value in health
care. It enables highly customized responses to
individual problems. It is based on one-to-one
patient–professional relationships where there
is a predictable cycle of steps, including case
acquisition, developing a diagnosis, selecting
a customized treatment, and testing of the
proposed solution. This model was formed in
the mid-20th century (Kaba & Soorikumaran,
2007), when the complexity of medical care
was far more limited. The main tradeoff in the
value shop is between breadth (the number
and diversity of conditions that can be managed) and depth (the level of expertise that can
be provided). As the number of diagnostic and
therapeutic interventions has increased, medical knowledge expanded, and expectancies
for longer and better life increased, the “shop”
has changed. The tradeoff has been managed
by moving from work done by individual professionals who knew what was needed and
acted accordingly, to work done by multiple
professionals from multiple disciplines in
organizational systems supported by information systems and greatly increasing contributions by patients (Batalden, Ogrinc, &
Batalden, 2006).
The value chain represents another way
of creating value (Porter, 1985). It consists of
repeatable, standardized treatment processes
that professionals and patients use to produce
the desired outcome. In product manufacturing, value chains have enabled gains in efficiency linking processes and standardization.
For those products and activities in health
care service systems that are similar, this mental model may be very helpful. For example,
adopting a chain model for total hip and knee
repair may result in efficiency of the linked

Road Map for the Future

processes, improved outcomes, and lower
costs. Two key tradeoffs in the value chain
architecture are between cost and differentiation. Very efficient chains (e.g., those with the
fewest, most standardized processes) are less
able to address a diversity of needs. This is why
some attempts to “install” the chain model
widely in health care service systems have been
frustrating. The challenge is that only a modest
percentage of health care service really fits this
product–chain framework. Indeed, patients
with complex medical problems might resent
being treated to standardized solutions and
experts who advertise that they are less expensive. When something major is wrong, patients
want the most customized care possible.
The value network represents a third way
of creating value. A value network is a set of
activities that facilitates interaction among
people, places, and things (e.g., patients, clinicians, researchers, organizational entities, and
databases). Learning Health Systems, in which
science, informatics, incentives, and culture are
aligned for continuous improvement and innovation, with best practices seamlessly embedded in the delivery process and new knowledge
captured as an integral by-product of the delivery experience (IOM, 2013), is an example
of a value network. There is a vast literature
from economics, computer science, business,
mathematics and evolutionary biology that
provides the scientific basis for how networks
function and create value (Benkler, 2006; Wilson, Ostrom, & Cox, 2013). In other industries,
combinations of platforms and personnel facilitate networks to increase the efficiency and
effectiveness of interaction and exchange.

Research into Improvement
Science and Implementation
Science
In health care, and especially medical care,
evidence-based practice is defined by rigorous
research methods. At times, quality improvement research has been criticized because it does

325

not always require the rigor that is expected of
more traditional biomedical studies. As a consequence, the results of important CQI initiatives may not be disseminated in the literature
because they do not meet publication standards
regarding clarity of the study population, interventions, outcome measurements, and procedures for data collection (Pronovost & Wachter,
2006). As CQI continues to evolve into a broader
range of health applications—and there is an
increased focus on benefits, costs, and the value
of health care—there will be increased demand
for rigorous CQI studies, which will lead to better education of health professions students as
well as better education in research methods for
individuals working in the field. Furthermore,
there will be more widespread adoption of
guidelines for publishing quality improvement
initiatives, such as the Standards for QUality
Improvement Reporting Excellence (SQUIRE)
initiative (Davidoff et al., 2008). The SQUIRE
guidelines help authors write peer-reviewed,
usable articles about quality improvement in
health care so that findings may be easily discovered and widely disseminated.
It is important to clarify that rigor does
not always require large-scale randomized,
controlled clinical trials (RCTs). In fact, RCT
designs can sometimes be at cross-purposes
with quality improvement studies (Balestracci,
2009). Similarly, as described in Chapter 4, the
use of judgment sampling instead of scientific
random sampling to select cases for study is
often preferable in CQI initiatives (Perla, Provost, & Murray, 2013). Instead, rigorous studies should emphasize careful design, careful
selection of representative patients for study,
and analyses appropriate for the design chosen and the decision to be made; that is, in
some cases a descriptive analysis may be most
appropriate. Most important, rigor implies the
use of the scientific method and appropriate
attention to patient rights and privacy.
Research methods play an important role
but should not serve as an impediment to application of CQI innovations; rather, our research
perspective should be broadened to use a wider

326

Chapter 14 Future Trends and Challenges for Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care

array of methods to achieve our ultimate goal,
which is to make the correct decisions about
the application of new CQI ideas. In many
cases, the most cost-effective approach is best;
to reach the correct decision, we may be better
served by implementing a number of repetitive
small-scale trials, using a PDSA approach, by
which we learn and adapt from each cycle.
Many decisions can be made by simple
analyses of properly collected data, perhaps
substituting control charts for complex statistical inference models. In some cases, the use of
complex design and analysis strategies has produced strong evidence in favor of change, and
the widespread adoption of a new approach or
CQI tool has met resistance for reasons other
than scientific conclusions. Value considerations also enter into this discussion, as the use
of RCTs may be unduly expensive and may not
always be required and in some cases may not
be appropriate, since they may not include the
decision-making dimensions that are relevant
and will continue to be relevant in the future,
such as clinical experience and patient preference. This argument is especially pertinent
for CQI decisions as CQI continues to evolve
beyond medical care to other health sectors.
To address this multidisciplinary perspective,
it has been proposed that a transdisciplinary
model of evidence-based practice be developed
for application to a wide array of disciplines,
including nursing, psychology, social work
and public health, in addition to medicine.
Such a model can be grounded in an ecological framework, such as that presented earlier
in Figure 14.1, and can include an emphasis on shared decision making, an increasing
demand in health care as well as other health
disciplines (Satterfield et al., 2009).
Where more complex methods are
required to make decisions, a broader array
of research tools that have been proven to be
effective should be considered, spanning both
traditional experimental designs and observational studies using quasi-experimental
designs (Shadish, Cook, & Campbell, 2002).
Likewise, consideration should be given to

qualitative research methods, as they offer
unique tools and perhaps more in-depth probing to help understand the needs of patients,
providers, and administrators while complementing and providing context to traditional
quantitative methods. Qualitative research
has an important role in that it can provide
insights into both the quality and safety of care.
More importantly, it can provide insight into
what may be required to improve care because
improvement work requires contextual data
about health care settings—specifically the
people, processes, and patterns that make up
the daily work of providing health care.
Implementation science, introduced and
described in substantial detail in Chapter 3,
will be critical to ensuring that best practices for clinical care, research, and quality
improvement are well implemented. Multiple
implementation frameworks and models exist,
but perhaps most importantly is the focus on
understanding the context in which a CQI initiative was developed and how and where it is
adapted for use in other practice settings. Context is critical to understanding why some CQI
initiatives are very successful in one setting but
do not translate well to other settings; from a
design perspective, this can be considered
an issue of poor generalizability (i.e., limited
external validity) (Shadish, Cook, & Campbell,
2002; Speroff et al., 2004).
One of the key issues that we have faced
in the past and that could limit CQI use in
the future is failure of a CQI initiative that has
been successful on a small scale (e.g., a specific
project) to be scalable. The challenge is how to
demonstrate improvement on a larger scale, or
in other settings with value added to the organizations in which it is applied. This has been
attributed to a variety of factors, including
lack of fidelity in its application and failure to
explain and understand the context in which
the initiative was carried out (Dixon-Woods
& Martin, 2016). For example, a 2016 systematic review of Lean interventions indicated
only limited process improvement impact,
and there was evidence of negative impacts in

Conclusions

regard to value, as indicated by high financial
costs and poor worker satisfaction (Moraros,
Lemstra, & Nwankwo, 2016).
What is the context where our improvement work takes place? Clinical process
improvement takes place at the front line of care,
where providers and patients meet. This can
be a clinic, an operating room, an emergency
department, a community health center, etc.
Context can be defined as: “Understanding how and why programs work—not simply whether they work” (Dixon-Woods et al.,
2011, p. 167). The use of evidence-based methods directly influences the internal validity of
a CQI process, but it is external validity that
must be considered as well when we intend
to generalize a successful implementation to
another setting, time or place; this requires
careful attention to context. “Knowing how
the contextual features compare to one’s own
circumstances is key to determining the generalizability and relevance of results. The context
of individual, group, organization, and system
characteristics that surround and interact with
the quality improvement initiative may explain
critical conditions or barriers to replication”
(Speroff et al., 2004, p. 35).
Understanding and carefully evaluating
context of successful CQI methods plays a
significant role in generalizability of the CQI
implementation to other settings. Care must
be taken avoid what some authors call “looking
for the magic bullet” without careful attention
to fidelity and context of successful approaches
that we adopt, especially from other industries;
this helps to explain some of the controversy
about the wholesale use of checklists; for
example, see Ramaswamy et al. (2018) and
Bosk et al. (2009). Dixon-Woods and Martin
(2016) provide a very good description of steps
that should be taken to “improve the quality
of quality improvement,” including greater
attention to context and fidelity and the need
to focus on organizational and larger program
(vs. project) issues when scaling CQI initiatives. Similarly, guidelines have been developed for the appraisal of PDSA methodology

327

that appears in the literature, before accepting
individual study findings and generalizing
them to other settings (Speroff et al., 2004).
The Salzburg Global Seminar Session
565 brought together improvement leaders
from 22 countries and included researchers,
evaluators, and improvers. The primary conclusion that resulted from the session was the
need for evaluation to be embedded as an integral part of the improvement (Massoud et al.,
2018). Evaluation can take many forms, but for
improvement work, Ramaswamy et al. call for
“unpacking the black box” of improvement,
where the black box is actually the complex
relationship between improvement and context (Ramaswamy et al., 2018).

Conclusions

Our vision for this edition of Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care was to provide a
foundation for those interested in learning about
CQI—the history of the field as well as some of
the most relevant topics in improving quality
and safety. But at the same time an important
goal was to identify what has changed since the
last edition and what we have learned in health
care about CQI; new methods and new applications (e.g., from other fields) that have become
part of the latest wave of the evolution of CQI
from industry to health care. Probably the most
important new application to have evolved
into health care CQI has been implementation
science, addressing the critical issue of how to
put into practice the innovations and improvements that we have developed through the CQI
methodology described here and elsewhere.
Another important new idea is the expansion of
the Triple Aim (an important concept that has
helped to increase the use of CQI methods) by
introducing a fourth aim directed at improving
provider well-being via the Quadruple Aim.
A new, but old concept that has re-emerged is
the need for a greater focus on value in health
care. In parallel with new ideas and applications
has been a further broadening of CQI to other

328

Chapter 14 Future Trends and Challenges for Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care

sectors of health and to other geographic locations that have institutionalized CQI as a way
ensuring quality, safety and continuous innovation. The interprofessional learning and adaption from medicine to nursing to public health
and from developed countries to an increasing
number of developing regions is illustrative of
the growth that has occurred.
While great progress has been made we
are sobered by the realization that much more
needs to be done. As with health care itself
wider adoption of new scientific methods have
led to a new vision of what can be achieved, and
through an ongoing learning process we recognize how to achieve that vision, but also realize
that some mistakes have been made along the
way, which can only be corrected by applying
the scientific method, through ongoing education about what we have done right and what
we have done wrong. We have learned that
more is not necessarily better. For example,
electronic medical records are important and
useful, but not always optimal to achieve the
specificity needed to carry out CQI initiatives,
which rely detailed measurement of change
over time. Thus, we have also evaluated what
works well, what doesn’t, and how to close that
gap. For example, the successes achieved by a
focus on the Triple Aim have been shown to be
important but also in need of further improvement, giving rise to the Quadruple Aim.
We have illustrated that broader applications of CQI in multiple health care arenas
have led to improved quality and safety, but
have also provided lessons for what is missing
in the methodology of CQI and the understanding of how to apply these powerful methods correctly and efficiently.
At the same time, we have reiterated some
of the constants regarding what must be done
to bring value to the patient experience as we
continue our improvement work. We have
reinforced the importance of understanding
variation, teamwork and leadership to foster
organizational learning and create a culture of
safety and quality throughout all health sectors, locally and globally.

The other important growth trend that
has continued since our last edition has been
within health delivery. The goal in health care
should be to treat not one condition at a time
but the total patient—as the patient progresses
through the many phases of care, across
diverse care settings, with different teams
of providers caring for the patient’s multiple
overlapping conditions. The future will surely
bring linkages aided by technology for collaboration across health care sectors and will lead
to a new, broader goal for CQI to break out of
our silos.
Finally, we recognize the challenges of
ongoing CQI growth, including the need for
the greatest rigor in CQI research and the
need to emphasize value—not only in the large
health care systems of the industrialized world
but perhaps especially in low- and middleincome countries where health challenges are
enormous, and funding is in short supply.
We find it fitting to conclude this chapter
with words from Avedis Donabedian, one of
the most well-recognized forefathers of quality
in health care (Best & Neuhauser, 2004):
Systems awareness and systems
design are important for health professionals, but they are not enough.
They are enabling mechanisms only.
It is the ethical dimensions of individuals that are essential to a system’s success. Ultimately, the secret of
quality is love. You have to love your
patient, you have to love your profession, you have to love your God.
If you have love, you can then work
backward to monitor and improve
the system. (p. 472)
With Donabedian’s words in mind, and
with the future growth of CQI not an option
but a necessity, we close this discussion with
one further question, “Who are the future
leaders in health care, and where are they
from?” The answer is easy: They will come
from us, our students, and our children.
