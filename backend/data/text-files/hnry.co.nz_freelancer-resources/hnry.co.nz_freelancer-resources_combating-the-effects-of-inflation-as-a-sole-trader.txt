Weâ€™re not going to sugarcoat it; inflation has been especially hard on sole traders.
If youâ€™ve been feeling the cost-of-living pinch, youâ€™re not alone. As of October 2022, 74% of sole traders say theyâ€™re eating into their savings, or saving less, and a whopping 85% are paying more for their supplies and services.

In more bad news, rates arenâ€™t rising to keep up with increasing costs. Fewer sole traders raised their prices in the last few months than during the beginning half of this year, suggesting that weâ€™re hitting a pricing ceiling. Worst of all half of all sole traders believe theyâ€™ve worked for less than minimum wage in the last six months.

We arenâ€™t going to suggest that thereâ€™s a silver lining to all of this - itâ€™s been a rough few years, and you donâ€™t need to hear any more empty cliches/platitudes. What we have for you instead are five practical suggestions to help ease the strain of inflation on your sole trader business.

1. Automate everything you can
Research shows that sole traders are only spending around half of their working week (55%) on actual work - the rest gets taken up with admin and taxes (18%), finding work (15%), and things like travel (12%). Freeing up some of this time could mean taking on more projects, or working bigger contracts, resulting in a boost to your bottom line.



Start by identifying the boring, repetitive tasks that drain your soul. For example, is chasing invoices taking up a lot of your time? Are you struggling to find new clients? At the risk of sounding like an infomercial, are taxes getting you down? Good news - thereâ€™ll be a way to either streamline that task, or automate it completely!

Once you know what you donâ€™t want to deal with anymore, you can start finding the right solution for your needs. That could mean anything from creating a booking form on your website, to building an automatic sales pipeline in excel, to letting Hnry automatically chase clients who are late paying their invoices (politely, of course).

Automating now can mean huge time savings down the line. If you can free up just two extra hours a week, youâ€™ll save 104 hours per year â€“ thatâ€™s the equivalent of creating an extra two and a half working weeks a year. What could you do with that extra time?

Hnry customers save 3 hours and a week and $138 a month on financial and tax admin. Hereâ€™s how:
No more reconciling transactions - we do it all for you every time youâ€™re paid into your Hnry bank account
No more chasing invoices â€“ if a client is late paying, weâ€™ll send them a reminder email. People who use this feature get paid an average of 5x faster!
No more saving expense receipts â€“ simply take a photo, upload it to the app, and weâ€™ll review your claim and store your receipts for you
No more calculating and deducting your own taxes - we calculate, deduct, and pay all your taxes every time you get paid.




2. Claim all the deductions youâ€™re entitled to
We canâ€™t stress this one enough: Claiming business expenses can save you thousands of dollars each year. If youâ€™re not claiming everything youâ€™re entitled to, thatâ€™s significant savings left on the table.

The problem is, the IRD doesnâ€™t automatically accept every business expense as a tax deduction.

As a general rule, you can claim a tax deduction for a business expense as long as:

the expense relates directly to earning income,
or running your business.
This, however, is just a starting point. You should also know that:

Not every business expense will be a valid tax deduction
Not every tax deduction is a business expense
Some tax deductions are industry specific. A tradie wonâ€™t be able to claim everything a clown can for example, and vice versa.
We know, itâ€™s as clear as mud. So how do you know that youâ€™re claiming everything you should claim?

The IRD website and business.govt.nz are good starting points for learning about expenses
Beyond that, itâ€™s always a good idea to talk through your expenses with an accountant (or Hnry tax specialist in the chat box below!). They might spot something youâ€™ve missed.

3. Review your cash flow
If you havenâ€™t come across this term before, it does what it says on the tin: cash flow refers to the flow of cash through your business. Unlike profit, which is a single number calculated at the end of the financial year (usually), cash flow factors in the timing of incoming and outgoing funds. Very simply, positive cash flow means you have more coming into your bank account than going out at any given time; negative cash flow means the opposite.

Cole runs a bakery that supplies bread to restaurants. Every month, he spends $1000 on supplies, in order to create $3000 worth of product for his clients. On the first of the month, Cole makes his usual $1000 purchase, and starts baking bread. Unfortunately, his biggest client can't pay him immediately, and instead asks to pay him one lump sum for all their bread in six months' time. For fear of losing the contract, Cole agrees. Three months later, Cole runs out of money to purchase supplies. Even though his business is profitable, because of the delay in payment, it's cash flow negative. Cole is forced to close up shop.
Take a look at your businessâ€™ income and expenditure for a single month. Do the numbers balance, or do you need to make some changes? Do you need to start chasing invoices earlier? Could you renegotiate payment terms with your suppliers? If you canâ€™t avoid negative cash flow, could your business benefit from a loan?

A higher cost of living makes tight margins even tighter. Do anything and everything you can to stay cash flow positive, and give yourself some breathing room.

4. Repackage your services
As the economy contracts, raising your rates might become harder and harder to do. Everyone is trying to get the most bang for their buck, and the fear of losing work due to high prices is a real one. So how do you maintain a fair hourly rate without scaring clients away?

One strategy is to rethink what you offer, and how you price your services.

If youâ€™re an efficient freelancer writer who charges by the hour, your hourly rate could go up if you charge per project.
If youâ€™re a tradie, you could bundle small services together into a more cost-effective package.
If you bake intricate cakes, you could subsidise larger, time-intensive order with quick and high-profit cupcake runs.
If youâ€™re a makeup artist, you could do drunk glow-up classes at bachelorette parties (weâ€™d sign up).
If youâ€™re a clown at kids partiesâ€¦ uhâ€¦ what about retirement homesâ€¦? (Sorry, weâ€™re not fully up on the industry, but weâ€™re rooting for you!)
The point is, all business strategies need tweaking from time to time. Now could be a good opportunity to introduce something new.



5. Take care of your mental health
We know that thereâ€™s already a lot out there on mental health, so weâ€™re going to keep this short and sweet.

1. You are your business. Your business is you. If your mental health tanks, your business will struggle. From this perspective, taking care of your mental health isnâ€™t just essential, itâ€™s good business sense.

2. Itâ€™s tempting to bite off more than you can chew when times get tough, but itâ€™s not a good long term strategy. If you have to put in extra hours, do your best to create time and space to recharge. Pay attention to your own warning signs; donâ€™t push past your limits.

3. Being a sole trader can be hard, especially when youâ€™re just starting out. Donâ€™t be afraid to lean on your networks, and ask for help if you need it. There are a lot of kind people out there who will gladly give you a hand, and one day youâ€™ll be able to do the same for someone else.

4. If possible, donâ€™t neglect the basics. Good food, enough rest, fun exercise, time with friends and family. These four things are the pillars of good mental health, and can keep you steady when things get rough.

Despite all the challenges, being a sole trader is intensely rewarding. The autonomy, freedom, satisfaction, balance - there are so many reasons why more and more people go at it alone.

If youâ€™re struggling right now, know that it wonâ€™t last, and youâ€™re definitely not alone. We hope these suggestions have helped in some way, and weâ€™re here to support you in whatever way we can.
