Your payments get processed and paid out to you within minutes of money being received into your Hnry Account.  As soon as your clients pay you via your Hnry Bank Account, the system automatically calculates, deducts and pays the right amount of all your taxes, before immediately passing the remaining amount onto you. You will also receive a payslip to let you know when you've been paid. We don’t hold on to your funds for any longer than we have to, so as long as your Client pays you before 9pm Monday-Friday (the time the bank stops processing for the day) then you’ll get paid the same day.  Please note that for payments received after 9pm (or on weekends and Public Hoildays), the bank will process these the next working day.
