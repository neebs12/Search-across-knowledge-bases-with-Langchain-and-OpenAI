If you’re considering working independently, using Hnry is the simplest way to get up and running without having to research all the ins and outs of the compliance.  You don't need to learn the details of all the tax rules, you don't need to manage a cashbook, and, most importantly, you don't need to worry.  All you do need to do is make sure that your clients pay you using your Hnry Bank Account number and we'll take care of the rest - making all your tax payments, doing your tax returns, and if needed, we'll even talk to the IRD/ATO on your behalf so you don't have to. We like to think of ourselves as a one-stop shop, so if you need to raise quotes and invoices, or claim expenses etc, then this can all be done via our app (we'll even chase overdue payments for you).  We understand that starting out can be overwhelming, so we have a huge repository of Help articles to help guide you through the process and explain how things work should you need it. Plus we have a team on hand to help you with any gnarly questions you may have, we've pretty much seen it all so you're in good hands!
