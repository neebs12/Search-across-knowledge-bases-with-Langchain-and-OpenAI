When you’re with Hnry, all your taxes get paid and filed – you don’t need to do anything. Not only that, but you can also use Hnry to do all of the following:



handle all of your invoicing – we'll even follow up with clients who are late paying

manage expenses – we'll ensure that you get all the proper tax relief

manage relationships with government agencies – we'll make payments on your behalf to ensure that you never have to think about tax and compliance again

sort out good professional insurance deals

create automatic payments through our 'Allocations' feature.

Using Hnry means you don't need to pay for a subscription for any accounting software.



Hnry also works really closely with accountants to free up their time from doing manual calculations so that they can spend time helping you to grow your business.



N.B If you run a small-to-medium sized business, controlling inventory and payroll, then accounting software like Xero and MYOB will most certainly help your business run effectively. If you take director's drawings while running your business, Hnry can help you take care of taxes and compliance on your personal earnings. In these cases, a mix of Hnry and accounting software is a safe way to go.
