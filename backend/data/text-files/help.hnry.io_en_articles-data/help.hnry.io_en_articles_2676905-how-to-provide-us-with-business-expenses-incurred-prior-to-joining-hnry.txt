You can sign up to Hnry at any time of the year, regardless of whether youâ€™ve earned income this year or whether you currently have an accountant.



We can even take into account any business expenses you may have incurred to date. For us to take these into account, we need all the relevant information, through the below process:



Please note: the Hnry team does not start reviewing your expenses until after your clients have started paying you into your Hnry Bank Account.



Bulk Upload by Category:

If you have previously been using another accounting system to store expenses, and do not wish to load these again into the Hnry platform, then you can instead provide us with the total spent for each category, for each month prior to joining Hnry.



You can do this via the Pre-Hnry expenses option under the Expenses tab on your Profile. Please note that you can only do this process ONCE.

If you later find pre-Hnry expenses that you did not include in this process, you will need to load these into the system individually instead.











The same rules apply for bulk uploads as they do for individual expense claims, so make sure to follow the rules that pop-up when you select your category. For example, you can claim up to 25% of petrol without a logbook, but if you do have a log-book and want to claim more, you would just change the default percentage for that claim.



N.B: If you choose to provide us with just the totals of prior expenses, rather than individually uploading past receipts, you need to be aware that we cannot warrant the compliance of these claims as we will not get to sight and approve the receipts as per our usual processes. In this case, you will also be required to hold onto those receipts for 7 years and be able to produce them should IRD request them.
