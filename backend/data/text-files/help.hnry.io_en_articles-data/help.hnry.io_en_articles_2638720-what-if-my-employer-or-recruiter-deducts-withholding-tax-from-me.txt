Here at Hnry, we ensure that all of your tax obligations are taken care of.



If you are working for clients or recruiters that deduct Withholding Tax from you, they are essentially just pre-paying a portion of your Income Tax obligation for you. You are still required to pay;

The balance of Income Tax owing against those earnings

ACC levies

GST (if applicable)

KiwiSaver (if applicable)

Student Loan payments (if applicable)

We are perfectly set up to cater for this scenario, our system allows you to log what percentage of Withholding Tax you have agreed for your Client or Recruiter to deduct from each payment e.g. 10%, 20% and our system will "top up" any additional Income Tax owing against those earnings as well as pay all of the other relevant taxes for you.



E.g. Based on your Annual Income, to pay the exact amount of Income Tax owing for your earnings, your tax rate may need to be 28.7%.



Your Client or Recruiter would deduct and pay a fix percentage i.e. 10% and we would deduct and pay the remaining 18.7% to ensure you have paid exactly the right amount of tax so you don't get left with a tax bill at the end of the financial year). In addition to this, we will also make all necessary ACC, GST, KiwiSaver and/or Student Loan payments for you (which your Client or Recruiter can't do)



You just need to ensure you indicate under your "Client" in the system the Withholding Tax rate they will be deducting prior to payment, have your pay come into your Hnry account and we'll take care of the rest  - easy!
