Setting up your eCommerce system with Hnry is as easy as changing your bank account details in your platform of choice.



Here are the general steps to follow across the board:



Add your Hnry Bank Details to your platform of choice

These can be found in Hnry by navigating to My Account > Settings > Financial.

If your platform transaction fees are charged outside of your payments, you can claim these as an expense.
