Invoicing and Quoting Clients in Foreign Currencies
You can send Invoices and Quotes to Clients based overseas, in the local currency of those Clients. Just update this in the Client's info.
In the Client's details screen, just navigate to the 'Advanced Options' selector to choose the currency you'd like your Invoices and Quotes to that Client to be in.




You can select from the following options:

Australian Dollars (AUD)

Canadian Dollars (CAD)

Chinese Yuan (CNY)

Japanese Yen (JPY)

Euros (EUR)

Fijian Dollars (FJD)

Pound Sterling (GBP)

Singapore Dollars (SGD)

Swiss Francs (CHF)

United States Dollars (USD)

Please note: currency selection will apply to the Client, so any Invoices you send to them will be in that chosen currency. Client Reimbursements – costs that you incur while completing work for a Client – will be in NZD.



Once you've chosen a currency for that Client, you can send an Invoice or Quote to them and the price amounts will display in that currency:








Then, just send that Quote or Invoice like you normally would. If you have any questions about how Quoting or Invoicing in a foreign currency might work for you, please don't hesitate to get in touch with the team!
