What if I get paid by clients outside of New Zealand?
It won't be a problem, as long as they can pay you into an NZ account.
If you are working for someone outside of New Zealand, then you can definitely still use Hnry. This works if you're employed by an Australian company, for instance, but work remotely from New Zealand.



In order for you to get paid, you can either:

Create and send a foreign currency invoice to your Client using Hnry

Have them make an overseas banking transfer directly into your Hnry Bank Account using these details

Use a 3rd party payment provider, e.g. Paypal, Payoneer, Stripe etc.



If you would like to find out more about how to set yourself up to be able to work for overseas clients, check out this article or get in touch with one of our team today.



N.B. If you are a tax resident of multiple countries then please contact one of our team (support@hnry.co.nz) so that we can determine if Hnry is right for you.
