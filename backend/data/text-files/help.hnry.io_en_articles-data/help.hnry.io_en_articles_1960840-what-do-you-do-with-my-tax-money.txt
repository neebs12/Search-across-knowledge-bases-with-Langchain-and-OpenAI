As soon as your clients pay funds into your Hnry Bank Account, we deduct all relevant taxes and pass your money on to you immediately with no delays. At the same time, we pay tax funds and allocations through to their relevant accounts.



We don't hold on to any money for any longer than we have to.



In the very short time that your money is in your Hnry Bank Account, it is not invested in any sort of assets and stays entirely liquid.
