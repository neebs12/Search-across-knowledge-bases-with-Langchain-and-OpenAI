How do I know my tax is being paid?
You'll get a Pay Summary (payslip) and you can see what taxes have been paid by checking myIR.

Every time you get paid, you'll receive a Pay Summary from us, which details all the taxes that have been deducted and paid on your behalf - just like when you have a permanent job.



You can also go on MyIR and see that your taxes have been paid. Please note that payments may not appear in MyIR immediately.



We provide you with all the exact detail of every cent we've paid on your behalf, to make sure you have absolute clarity on where taxes have been deducted and paid.
