Go toMigration of data from Xero - Not GST RegisteredMigration of data from Xero - Not GST Registered. A step-by-step guide to providing us with your expense data from Xero for the periods prior to joining Hnry when you are not GST Registered. We appreciate that if you have already spent your time loading expenses into Xero for the current Financial Year, then you probably don't want to repeat the exercise again in Hnry. If this is the case, you have the option of providing us just the totals for each category so we can take these into account when setting your tax rate (as any business expenses will help to reduce the amount of Income Tax you need to pay). Here's how; Log into XeroSelect Accounting, then Reports Under the Accounting reports section, select Profit and Loss Choose the start date 1 April 20xx (start of current Financial Year) OR the date in this Financial Year that you started earning self-employed income if this is your first yearThe end date should be the end of the month prior to joining Hnry NB: All expenses for the current month and onward, should be raised individually in Hnry.  If GST registered the end date should be the last day of the month of your first GST period in the current financial year e.g. if you are on 6-monthly GST and your filing period is 1 April 2019 to 30 September 2019 then you would select the 30th September     NB: All expenses relating to your current/upcoming GST period should be raised individually in Hnry. Sort by Account CodeSelect Cash Basis and Show YTD boxesClick Update At the bottom of the page, select Export/PDF You can then use this document as the receipt when loading the totals by category into the Hnry System            NB: Everyone has Xero set up slightly differently but essentially, you only need to worry about the items on the Profit and Loss relating to expenses. The standard expense categories in Xero are similar to the below (if you're not sure, a tip is that they should not have an Opening Balance and will primarily only have a Debit amount unless you have received a refund)  Loading these Expenses into Hnry To add pre-Hnry expenses efficiently, you just need to provide us with the total spent for each category for each month before joining Hnry. Log into your Hnry dashboard and go to Expenses. Click on the Pre-Hnry expenses option at the top of this page to enter these expenses in bulk format. Please note that you can only do this process ONCE.    Please Note: As we are not sighting any of the actual receipts, we cannot warrant that your claim is valid. You will need to hold onto any receipts for Business Expenses claimed in this way for 7 years should IRD request copies.   Did this answer your question?
