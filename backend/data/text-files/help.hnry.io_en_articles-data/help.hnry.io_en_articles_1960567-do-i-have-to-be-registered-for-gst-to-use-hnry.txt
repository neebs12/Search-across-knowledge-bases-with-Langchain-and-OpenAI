You don’t need to be registered for GST to sign up with Hnry, however, if you will be earning over $60,000 in a 12-month period, IRD says that you must be GST registered.  If you are not already registered for GST as a sole trader, you can do this through the myIR portal – it only takes a couple of minutes. Once you have received confirmation of your GST Registration from IRD, you can get in touch with the Hnry team, and we can update this for you on your Hnry Dashboard. NB: If you don't send invoices to your Client or Recruiter, then make sure you also remember to let them know that you are now GST Registered  If you're ready to use Hnry, sign up below: Sign up to HnryIf you're still unsure, and you'd like to find out whether Hnry might be right for you, answer our short questionnaire below: Is Hnry for me?Did this answer your question?
