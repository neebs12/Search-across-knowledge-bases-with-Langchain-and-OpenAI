Hnry works for all sorts of customers: Photographers, Tradies, Drivers, Freelance Designers, Business Analysts, Real Estate Agents - you name it!  If you earn any income as an independent earner, regardless of how much or how often you earn, or whether you go through a recruiter or direct, Hnry can take away the hassle of tax and compliance for you. Basically, if you’re earning independent income from any source other than salaried work, then it is likely that Hnry is for you!  The only requirement we have is that ALL your self-employed (independent) income must come through your Hnry Account for us to ensure that we are able to accurately calculate, pay and file your taxes. N.B Unfortunately, Hnry does not currently support tax and compliance for people trading through a Registered Company.  If you are trading as a company and filing both company tax returns, as well as personal tax returns, we would recommend investigating whether it's worth switching to solely filing IR3 returns as a sole trader. If you’re a sole trader, you can still have a business and claim business expenses, have a trading name etc, without needing to operate under a company structure.
