The Hnry service is ‘pay-as-you-go’ and therefore we manage and file your Income Tax and GST returns due from the date you first get paid into your Hnry account. If you have outstanding tax returns from prior to joining us then definitely get in touch as our Expert Services team should be able to help you with this for a one-off fee - please contact our team at support@hnry.co.nz for further details.
