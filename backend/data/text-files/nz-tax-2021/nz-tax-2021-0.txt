The statutory basis of income tax in New Zealand is the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Together, these Acts are the latest in a series of statutes, dating back to the late 1800s, that deal with a tax on income. These Acts are the prime source of all the current law on the subject and an understanding of their basic provisions is essential to anyone studying the subject or dealing with income tax problems. Tax legislation is possibly the most  complicated area of legislation in New Zealand and is subject to numerous amendments every year. The passing of the Income Tax Act 2007 in December 2007 completed the project to rewrite New Zealand’s income tax legislation. The 2007 Act came into effect on 1 April 2008. The Income Tax Act deals with income tax and other taxes derived from the income tax system. Fringe benefit tax, employer’s superannuation contribution tax and resident and non-resident withholding taxes are examples of taxes imposed under the main taxing statute. Amendments are made to the Act each year and are read as though they were part of the principal Act, applying from the time specified in the amendment Act. This means that the Act, as originally passed, does not state the law as it will apply in later years. The Act must be read along with its subsequent amendments. Inland Revenue (IR) administers the tax system. IR’s powers and responsibilities are set out in the Tax Administration Act. This Act charges the IR’s chief executive, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, with the care, management and collection of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts. In carrying out his or her duty, the Commissioner is required to collect, over time, the highest net revenue practicable within the law. The Commissioner is authorised to make binding rulings, assessments, determinations relating to financial arrangements and determinations for other purposes. The Tax Administration Act also authorises the Governor-General to issue directions to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, but only in relation to the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. These directions are made by Order in Council. The Governor-General is not authorised to give directions concerning the tax affairs of individual taxpayers or the interpretation of tax law. The Tax Administration Act and the Income Tax Act require taxpayers to self-assess their income tax liabilities. However, it is the Commissioner who administers the tax system and issues assessments on default or after investigations. Regulations for various purposes under the Income Tax Act may be made by the Governor-General. Any regulations and orders made  under earlier Acts continue to have effect as though they were made under the Income Tax Act, unless they are specifically revoked. Regulations have been made to deal with matters such as general administration and machinery provisions (eg the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998, which outline the disputes resolution procedures). Numerous orders have been made under specific sections of the Act relating to very specialised matters.  ¶1-020 The tax statutes A brief history of taxation The origins of income tax can be traced to the Napoleonic Wars. To finance the conduct of the wars, a duty known as income tax was imposed in the United Kingdom, as a temporary measure, from 1799 to 1802 and 1803 to 1816. It was reintroduced as a temporary measure in 1842, but this time the duty was never removed. Income tax was first imposed in New Zealand by the Land and Income Assessment Act 1891. That Act, with subsequent amendments, was consolidated in 1900. Further consolidating Acts were passed in 1908, 1916, 1923 and 1954. Various other types of tax were imposed by those Acts. The importance of income tax increased, however, and the proportion of revenue collected by that tax rose, particularly compared with that from land tax, until it was the dominant source of Government revenue. In 1976 Parliament split the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 into two Acts. These were the Income Tax Act 1976 and the Land Tax Act 1976 (the latter being abolished from 31 March 1992 by the Land Tax Abolition Act 1990). In December 1994 Parliament enacted the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994, marking the first phase in a four-step process to rewrite the Income Tax Act 1976. In July 1996 the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 rewrote Pts A and B of the Income Tax Act 1994. In May 2004 the Income Tax Act 2004 received Royal assent. Briefly, this Act rewrote Pts A–E and Y of the Income Tax Act 1994. In November 2007, the Income Tax Act 2007 was enacted, containing the rest of the rewritten Parts and Schedules and re-enacting the Parts enacted under the 2004 Act. It applies from the 2008–09 income year.  The significance of taxation Income tax is important for two reasons. First, it is the Government’s principal source of revenue. In the “Annual Report 2020” document produced by Inland Revenue, published October 2020, the breakdown of revenue collected in the 2019–20 year by the three key tax types is shown as: ▪ income tax — 68% of revenue ▪ GST — 27% of revenue, and ▪ other indirect taxes, including excise taxes on tobacco, alcohol and petrol — 5% of revenue. This revenue is applied to finance many of the benefits offered by New Zealand’s welfare system. Secondly, it is a measure that influences most people’s standard of living. Most adults pay income tax but any who did not do so would be financially better off. Many taxpayers see income tax as an appropriation of their earnings. Many businesses, particularly the large-scale ones, see income tax as a business cost that must be kept to a minimum. Consequently, taxpayers are usually conscious of the possible tax implications when they come to arrange their financial affairs, and this outlook on the part of taxpayers accounts for many features of the income tax system. It has required the creation of a large bureaucratic organisation to administer and enforce the system, with the administrators being given wide powers to inquire into people’s financial affairs. It has also led to the pattern of constant amendment required not only to plug gaps but also to expand the tax base.  ¶1-025 Tax policy work programme On 8 August 2019, the Government released its updated tax policy work programme. The Government has the following objectives for the tax system: ▪ A system that is efficient, fair, simple, coherent and collects the tax that is due, on time and in full.  ▪ A progressive tax and transfer system for individuals and families. ▪ A system that promotes the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy. ▪ A system that supports a sustainable revenue base to fund government operating expenditure around its historical level of 30% of GSP. ▪ A system that treats all income and assets in a fair, balanced and efficient manner. The Government supports a sustainable broad-base low-rate framework for the tax system to ensure taxes are fair and efficient and they do not impede economic growth. This also helps keep compliance costs low and minimises opportunities for avoidance and evasion. The current tax policy work programme can be viewed on the Tax Policy website at taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/work-programme. Tax Working Group On 23 November 2017, Sir Michael Cullen was announced as the Chair of the Tax Working Group (TWG) and the terms of reference of the group were released. The members appointed to the group were announced on 20 December 2017. The Working Group was to report to the Government by February 2019 on: ▪ whether the tax system operates fairly in relation to taxpayers, income, assets and wealth ▪ whether the tax system promotes the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy ▪ whether there are changes to the tax system that would make it more fair, balanced and efficient, and  ▪ whether there are other changes that would support the integrity of the income tax system, having regard to the interaction of the systems for taxing companies, trusts and individuals. The Working Group was to consider in particular: ▪ the economic environment that will apply over the next 5–10 years, taking into account demographic change, and the impact of changes in technology and employment practices, and how these are driving different business models ▪ whether a system of taxing capital gains or land (not applying to the family home or the land under it), or other housing tax measures, would improve the tax system ▪ whether a progressive company tax (with a lower rate for small companies) would improve the tax system and the business environment, and ▪ what role the taxation system can play in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes, especially over the longer term. The following were outside the scope of the Working Group’s review: ▪ increasing any income tax rate or the rate of GST ▪ inheritance tax ▪ any other changes that would apply to the taxation of the family home or the land under it, and ▪ the adequacy of the personal tax system and its interaction with the transfer system (this will be considered as part of a separate review of Working for Families). Interim report The group released its interim findings in September 2018 in a report titled “Future of tax”. Some of the key findings included the following:  ▪ rather than a capital gains tax, extending the existing tax base to include gains on assets that are not already taxed or taxing deemed returns from certain assets (known as the risk-free rate of return method of taxation) ▪ the introduction of land or wealth taxes is ruled out ▪ removal of the employer’s superannuation contribution tax of 3% on employer’s contributions to KiwiSaver for those earning up to $48,000 per year ▪ a reduction in the lower PIE rates for KiwiSaver funds by five percentage points each ▪ simplification of the way in which PIE rates are determined (for KiwiSaver) ▪ the current GST rate should be maintained and exemptions (for example, for food) should not be introduced on the basis of complexity and additional compliance costs ▪ a financial transactions tax is not recommended but New Zealand should continue to monitor international debate in this area ▪ a review of the GST treatment of contractors and to align the definitions of “employee” and “independent contractor” for tax and employment purposes ▪ increasing the current $2,500 threshold for paying provisional tax to $5,000–$10,000 ▪ increasing the $10,000 year end trading stock adjustment to $20,000–$30,000 ▪ increasing the $10,000 threshold for deducting legal fees and potentially introducing a similar rule for other types of expenditure  ▪ piercing the corporate veil so that company shareholders and directors are liable for a company’s tax debts in certain circumstances, and ▪ in relation to environmental outcomes, extending the coverage of the Waste Disposal Levy, strengthening the emissions trading scheme and advancing congestion charging. The full report can be read at https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/future-tax-interim-report. Final report The TWG's report was released on 21 February 2019. It makes the following key recommendations with regards to the New Zealand tax system: ▪ Capital gains tax: Extend the existing coverage of taxing capital gains. Eight of the 11 members of the TWG favour a broad capital gains tax that will apply at full income tax rates, on realisation (sale or other disposal) of an asset and with no allowance for inflation. This is projected to raise $8.3 billion over five years, with revenue increasing over time. ▪ Environment taxes: In the short term, expand the coverage and rate of the Waste Disposal Levy, strengthen the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and advance the use of congestion charging. Strengthening the ETS would involve all emissions (including from agriculture) facing a price. Tax instruments that address water pollution and the extraction of water from rivers, streams and aquifers, are also discussed. ▪ Company tax: No plans to alter the company tax rate or move away from the imputation system. ▪ Personal income tax: Consider raising the bottom income tax threshold (currently $0–$14,000) to $20,000 or $30,000, and potentially combining this with an increase in the second marginal tax rate (currently 17.5%) to 21%.  ▪ Retirement savings: Encourage greater participation in KiwiSaver for low-income earners through various measures, including refunding the ESCT for KiwiSaver members earning less than $48,000, increasing the member tax credit from 0.50 to 0.75 per $1 of contribution and reducing the PIE rates for KiwiSaver funds. ▪ Digital services tax: Be ready to implement a digital services tax if a critical mass of other countries move in that direction and New Zealand’s export industries are not materially impacted. Other possible areas earmarked for reform are changes to the loss continuity rules for start-ups, bringing back depreciation deductions on buildings if capital gains tax is extended, expanding deductions for “black-hole” expenditure and concessions for nationally significant infrastructure projects. The report can be viewed in full at https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/future-tax-final-report. Government response to the final report of the Tax Working Group On 17 April 2019, the government released its responses to the recommendations of the Tax Working Group (TWG). The responses to the key recommendations referred to above are: ▪ Capital gains tax: No plans to proceed with the capital gains tax recommendations, but the government intends to explore options for taxing vacant land. ▪ Environment taxes: The government noted that work is already under way on many of the recommendations in this area, and the remaining recommendations are being considered for inclusion on the tax work programme. ▪ Company tax: Endorses the TWG recommendations regarding the company tax rate and imputation system. Other recommendations are being considered for inclusion on the tax work programme, with high priority given to the issues of depreciation for seismic strengthening and developing a regime  that encourages investment into nationally significant infrastructure projects. ▪ Personal income tax: Because the capital gains tax proposals are not being adopted, there is no revenue to recycle, and therefore no further work on these recommendations is necessary. ▪ Retirement savings: Recommendations being considered for inclusion on the tax work programme. ▪ Digital services tax: This work is already under way, with officials directed to draft a discussion document on the options for taxing the digital economy to be presented to Cabinet in May. The full list of 99 recommendations and the government’s response to each one can be viewed in full at https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/govt-responds-tax-workinggroup-report. Taxing the digital economy In May 2019, the Government released a discussion document, “Options for taxing the digital economy”. The discussion document seeks feedback on two options for taxing the “digital economy” as an interim measure pending an international solution which the OECD is currently working on. The term “digital economy” is broadly described as e-commerce that relies on information and communication technology, eg the sale of digital and physical products and services on the internet or using apps. It also includes activities such as online advertising, social networks and intermediary platforms such as Airbnb and Uber. The two options proposed are: ▪ A low rate (2% to 3%) digital services tax (DST) on the gross turnover that is attributable to New Zealand of highly digitalised businesses. The DST will be specifically targeted at intermediary platforms involved with facilitating the sale of goods  or services between people (like Uber and eBay), social media platforms (Facebook), content sharing sites (Instagram and YouTube), as well as search engines and the sale of user data. The DST is not intended to apply to the sale of online content, such as music, games, TV shows and newspapers. The DST will apply to multi-national groups that exceed two de minimis thresholds. Both thresholds would need to be exceeded in order for the DST to apply. The first is a country-by-country reporting of font=Arial charset=unicode code=8364 descr='[euro]'750 million of consolidated annual turnover. The second is a New Zealand specific threshold of $3.5 million a year, estimated to bring in approximately $100,000 of DST. ▪ Changing the current international income tax rules to allow more taxation in market countries (currently being discussed by the OECD and the G20 group of large economies). The Government notes that the DST will be an interim measure only. If a global solution is found by the OECD, the DST regime will be repealed.  LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK ¶1-030 Structure of the Tax Acts The Income Tax Act 2007 is organised in a structure of Parts and Subparts and follows the structure, drafting style and features of the Interpretation Act 1999. The following is a brief analysis of the Act: ▪ Part A sets out the Act’s purpose and principles for interpretation. ▪ Part B contains the core provisions. ▪ Part C defines income. ▪ Part D defines the extent to which deductions are allowed, and sets out how specific rules on deductions interact with the general rules on deductions.  ▪ Part E deals with the timing and quantification of income recognition and deductions. ▪ Part F recharacterises certain transactions. ▪ Part G contains the provisions relating to tax avoidance and nonmarket transactions. ▪ Part H provides for the tax treatment of certain specific entities. ▪ Part I contains provisions relating to tax losses. ▪ Part L sets out the entitlement to tax credits. ▪ Part M deals with the tax credits which are paid in cash. ▪ Part O contains the rules relating to memorandum accounts. ▪ Part R contains the general collection rules relating to the payment and withholding of tax. ▪ Part Y contains the definitions used in the Act and related matters. ▪ Part Z contains the amendments, repeals, savings and transitional provisions. Structure of the Tax Administration Act The Tax Administration Act 1994 contains most of the provisions relating to administrative and procedural aspects of income tax law. Formerly, these provisions were found in the Income Tax Act 1976 and the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 (except those provisions relating to the Taxation Review Authority). Among other things, the Tax Administration Act imposes reporting and disclosure obligations on taxpayers. It also sets out the offences and penalties imposed on taxpayers for breach of their tax obligations together with the procedure for disputes resolution. Its structure may be analysed as follows:  ▪ Part 1 — purpose and construction ▪ Part 2 — the roles of the Commissioner and Inland Revenue ▪ Part 2A — taxpayer’s principal tax obligations ▪ Part 3 — information, record-keeping and returns ▪ Part 3B — credits of tax ▪ Part 4A — disputes procedures ▪ Part 5 — determinations ▪ Part 5A — binding rulings ▪ Part 6 — assessments ▪ Part 7 — interest ▪ Part 7B — third-party providers ▪ Part 8 — objections (relating to pre-1 October 1996 assessments) ▪ Part 8A — challenges (to notices of disputable decisions issued after 1 October 1996) ▪ Part 9 — penalties ▪ Part 10 — recoveries ▪ Part 10A — tax recovery agreements ▪ Part 10B — transfers of excess tax ▪ Part 11 — remission, relief, and refunds ▪ Part 11B — foreign account information-sharing agreements  ▪ Part 13 — miscellaneous ▪ Part 14 — transitional provisions and savings. Taxation Review Authorities Act and Regulations The law relating to Taxation Review Authorities, whose function is to decide on challenges to assessments of taxes and to other decisions or determinations, is found in the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 and the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998.  ¶1-040 Fixing the tax rates Income tax rates are fixed annually. This is because of the constitutional convention that income tax should be imposed only on a yearly basis and that the Crown’s ability to collect revenue be subject to Parliament’s consent. The rates are fixed by an Act referred to as the annual taxing Act. In practice, such an Act simply adopts the tax rates set out in sch 1 to the Income Tax Act 2007. To remove the necessity of passing a separate Act each year for the sole purpose of fixing the tax rates, the rates may be set as part of a wider amending Act. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 set the rates for the 2019–20 year, and the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill, introduced into Parliament on 4 June 2020, proposes to set the rates for the 2020– 21 year. If an annual taxing Act is not passed, there is a savings provision in s 92A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 which enables the assessment for a tax year at the basic rates set out in sch 1 to the Income Tax Act. Such an assessment is not invalidated by the fact that it may have been made before the passing of an Act setting rates for the year concerned. Even without that provision, revenue would continue to flow to the Crown if Parliament did not sit or did not pass an annual taxing Act. This is because the PAYE tax deduction system under the principal Act would continue to operate.  Law: TAA s 92A  ¶1-050 The core provisions of the Income Tax Act The core provisions set out the key principles on which the rest of the income tax legislation is based. The provisions, found in Pt B of the Income Tax Act 2007, are intended to: ▪ impose tax liability ▪ specify the steps that a taxpayer must follow to arrive at the taxpayer’s tax liability ▪ provide a basis for applying the other Parts of the Income Tax Act, and ▪ set up the scheme of the Income Tax Act and the main links between its Parts. Terminology The Act follows a global or gross approach to the calculation of taxable income. Some of the key terms used in the core provisions include income, exempt income, excluded income, assessable income, deduction and allocation (or attribution). These components make up the taxpayer’s annual gross income and annual total deduction for the tax year. Law: IT07 Pt B  ¶1-055 Structure of the core provisions  The core provisions are structured as follows:  Subpart BB — income tax and resulting obligations Section BB 1 is the central charging provision. Income tax is imposed on taxable income at the rates set out in sch 1 to the Act. “Taxable income” means taxable income for a tax year calculated under s BC 5. See s YA 1 “taxable income”. Section BB 2 sets out a person’s main tax obligations. A person’s income tax liability must be calculated and satisfied in accordance with subpart BC (unless that person is a portfolio investment entity (PIE), in which case subpart HM must be applied (see ¶29-100)). An obligation to pay provisional tax and to satisfy any withholding liabilities as well as other obligations are also imposed. Section BB 3 provides that the Commissioner may counteract a tax advantage from a tax avoidance arrangement.  Subpart BC — calculating and satisfying of income tax liabilities Section BC 1 sets out the process to be followed by different types of taxpayers in order for them to satisfy their tax liabilities. The section provides that: ▪ the tax liability of a non-filing taxpayer is the total tax withheld from the taxpayer’s annual gross income ▪ the tax liability of a filing taxpayer is calculated under ss BC 2– BC 6, and ▪ the calculation of the tax liability of a filing taxpayer with schedular income is modified by s BC 7 (briefly, filing taxpayers with schedular income are life insurers, multi-rate PIEs, natural person investors in multi-rate PIEs deriving attributed PIE income, group investment funds, non-resident general insurers, non-resident shippers and taxpayers with non-resident passive income subject to final non-resident withholding tax). Once a taxpayer’s tax liability has been calculated, that liability may be satisfied first by offsetting any available tax credits and then through the payment of terminal tax. Special ordering rules determine the way in which excess credits may be set off against a taxpayer’s liability. This is to allow maximum credits for foreign taxes and other amounts that are limited to the level of domestic income tax liability. See ¶2-110. If credits remain after set-off in the stipulated order, the Commissioner may be required, under s LA 5, to make a refund of the remaining credits by applying ss LA 6–LA 8. See ¶1-400. Subpart BD — income, deductions, and timing Subpart BD defines the central elements that determine a taxpayer’s annual gross income. Briefly, the central elements are: ▪ income (including exempt income, excluded income, nonresidents’ foreign-sourced income and assessable income)  ▪ deductions, and ▪ timing (the allocation of income and deductions to particular income years). Income Amounts received that are income are listed in Pt C of the Income Tax Act 2007. There are five general income categories: ▪ income from business or trade-like activities — subpart CB ▪ income from holding property (divided into non-equity — subpart CC, and equity — subpart CD) ▪ income from employment — subpart CE ▪ pensions and government entitlements (such as benefits, compensation and government grants) — subpart CF, and ▪ recoveries (such as depreciation and bad debts recovered, remitted amounts, expenditure or loss recovered) — subpart CG. These are followed by subparts dealing with adjustments (eg the matching rules, change in accounting practice) and specific income types (PIEs, life insurance, superannuation funds, controlled foreign companies, foreign investment funds and petroleum and mineral miners) and entity-specific rules for certain taxpayers (eg group companies and Crown research institutes). Assessable income, exempt income, excluded income and nonresidents’ foreign-sourced income Assessable income is generally income that is derived by a taxpayer and that is subject to income tax in the tax year or a later tax year. The following types of income are specifically excluded from assessable income: ▪ “exempt income” under subpart CW or CZ  ▪ “excluded income” under subpart CX or CZ, provided the amount is not the taxpayer’s non-residents’ foreign-sourced income (see below), and ▪ “non-residents’ foreign-sourced income”. In broad terms, non-residents’ foreign-sourced income is made up of amounts derived by a non-resident, which are not treated as being derived from New Zealand, and the amounts are not income of a trustee under s HC 25 (see ¶25-035). This exclusion is intended to give effect to the basic source and residence rules set out in ¶1-110 and ¶1-120. Annual gross income Annual gross income is the amount of assessable income allocated to the income year. A taxpayer’s tax liability for the income year is calculated on the taxpayer’s annual gross income. Deductions A taxpayer is allowed a deduction for an amount under Pt D; see further at ¶1-220–¶1-221. Timing rules The rules for allocating amounts of income and deductions to their respective income years are set out in ss BD 3 and BD 4. The sections are intended to clarify whether a specific timing regime applies or not. If a specific timing regime applies, income or expenditure is allocated in accordance with that regime. For income, the relevant Parts are C and E–I. For deductions, the relevant Parts are D–I. If no such regime applies, income or expenditure is allocated to the year in which it is derived or incurred. Subpart BE — withholding liabilities The various withholding liabilities imposed under the Act are set out in s BE 1. These include amounts withheld from PAYE payments, amounts withheld from payments of resident passive income,  amounts withheld from payments of non-resident passive income, fringe benefit tax, employer superannuation contribution tax and retirement scheme contribution tax. Subpart BF — other obligations A number of additional obligations are imposed under the Act, such as the requirement to pay qualifying company election tax, income tax on taxable distributions from non-complying trusts, further income tax and residential land withholding tax. See s BF 1. Subpart BG — avoidance The prohibition against tax avoidance is split into two essential components — the voiding of tax avoidance arrangements and the Commissioner’s ability to counteract such arrangements. See s BG 1. Subpart BH — double tax agreements The overriding effect of double tax agreements is set out in s BH 1, which stipulates the purposes for which a double tax agreement may be entered into. Of particular note is s BH 1(6). This subsection provides that any reference to profits in a double tax agreement (DTA) shall be read as reference to net income, calculated as if the activity or business in question were the only activity or business. With effect from 30 March 2017, it has also been made explicit that the general anti-avoidance rule in s BG 1 can apply in the context of a DTA. Law: IT07 Pt B  ¶1-060 Obligations under the Tax Administration Act 1994 Additional compliance obligations are imposed on taxpayers under the Tax Administration Act 1994. In particular: ▪ If required, a taxpayer must furnish a return of income for the preceding tax year. See ¶1-360, ¶1-380 and ¶2-010. However, note that following changes to modernise the tax system, with  effect from 1 April 2019 those taxpayers who receive only reportable income will not have to file a return and they will automatically receive a refund or tax bill once their prepopulated account is finalised. See ¶2-016. ▪ The dates by which annual returns must be furnished are set out in s 37. ▪ A taxpayer must deduct or withhold the correct amounts of tax when required by law to do so. ▪ A taxpayer must disclose to the Commissioner all information that the law requires disclosure of. ▪ A taxpayer must co-operate with the Commissioner in the exercise of their powers under the tax laws. ▪ Before 1 April 2019, if the taxpayer was a natural person, they had to correctly respond to any income statement issued to them. A taxpayer’s tax obligations must be carried out to a reasonable standard of care. Failure to reach that standard will result in severe penalties on any tax shortfall. See further at ¶14-100 et seq. Law: TAA ss 15B, 33, 37, 92  INTERPRETATION OF TAX LEGISLATION ¶1-065 Interpreting tax legislation The approach taken by the courts when interpreting revenue statutes has changed over time. Initially, there was a strictly literal approach, based on the precise words of the particular section and nothing more. This has been succeeded by a more expansive view incorporating a more purposive approach whereby a particular provision is viewed by the court in the context of the overall structure and objectives of the legislation.  The leading cases on interpretation of tax statutes are Mangin v C of IR 70 ATC 6001; [1971] NZLR 591 and C of IR v Alcan New Zealand Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,175. Example 1: In a Privy Council case involving s 108 of the 1954 Act (the precursor to s 99 of the Income Tax Act 1976 and s BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007), Lord Donovan described the following rules for the interpretation of tax legislation: First, the words are to be given their ordinary meaning. They are not to be given some other meaning simply because their object is to frustrate legitimate tax avoidance devices. As Turner J says in his (albeit dissenting) judgment in Marx v Commissioner of Inland Revenue [1970] NZLR [182] at p 208, moral precepts are not applicable to the interpretation of revenue statutes. Secondly, “one has to look merely at what is clearly said. There is no room for any intendment. There is no equity about a tax. There is no presumption as to tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied. One can only look fairly at the language used” (Per Rowlatt J in Cape Brandy Syndicate v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1921] 1 KB 64, 71, approved by Viscount Simons LC in R v Canadian Eagle Oil Co Ltd [1946] AC 119; [1945] 2 All ER 499). Thirdly, the object of the construction of a statute being to ascertain the will of the Legislature it may be presumed that neither injustice nor absurdity was intended. If, therefore, a literal interpretation would produce such a result, and the language admits of an interpretation which would avoid it, then such an interpretation may be adopted. Fourthly, the history of an enactment and the reasons which led to its being passed may be used as an aid to its construction. See Mangin v C of IR 70 ATC 6001 at 6,003; [1971] NZLR 591 at 594.  Example 2: In a case concerning the meaning of the phrase “a group of companies” as defined in s 191(3) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now s IC 6), the Court of Appeal held that the arguments advanced by the Commissioner did not provide a sufficient basis for departing from the plain meaning of the words. After reviewing the principles of statutory interpretation, the Court of Appeal found it fundamental to all statutory interpretation that words be given their ordinary meaning. Where words can have more than one meaning and the object of the legislation is clear, then the words must be given “such fair, large and liberal construction” as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act. Where the words are unclear, or are reasonably capable of more than one meaning, the court prefers an interpretation that does not lead to injustice or absurdity, and one that accords with the evident purpose. The true meaning must be consonant with the words used, having regard to their context in the Act as a whole, and to the purpose of the legislation to the extent that this is discernible. See C of IR v Alcan New Zealand Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,175.  The Interpretation Act 1999 confirms the modern purposive approach to statutory interpretation adopted by the courts. Section 5 states that: ▪ the meaning of an enactment must be ascertained from its text and in light of its purpose ▪ the matters that may be considered in ascertaining the meaning of an enactment include the indications provided in the enactment, and ▪ examples of those indications are preambles, the analysis, a table of contents, headings to Parts and sections, marginal notes, diagrams, graphics, examples and explanatory material, and the organisation and format of the enactment. In addition, s AA 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides guidance on the use of the diagrams, flowcharts, readers’ notes and list of defined terms when interpreting the provisions of the Income Tax Act. The Supreme Court of New Zealand confirmed the purposive approach to interpretation of tax legislation in Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v C of IR, Accent Management Ltd v C of IR (2009) 24 NZTC 23,188. In the same case the Court also introduced the idea of interpreting a tax provision in light of Parliamentary contemplation and the policy behind the provision when it was enacted. It is up to the courts to apply a principled approach which gives effect to the statutory language when confronted with conflicting provisions. See [102] and [103] of the judgment. The Supreme Court in Penny and Hooper v C of IR (2011) NZTC ¶20-073 has firmly entrenched the “parliamentary contemplation” test in New Zealand tax law and the judiciary’s approach to tax avoidance analysis. See [47] of the judgment. See ¶33-105 for a discussion of interpretation of tax legislation in regard to tax avoidance. ACC and tax legislation compared  The High Court has held that accident compensation legislation should be interpreted differently from tax statutes. After considering analogies with cases decided under comparable definitions in income tax legislation, the Court found that tax statutes are concerned with taking money from citizens, whereas the accident compensation legislation was concerned with compensating people. See Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Corporation v Lewis (1994) 16 NZTC 11,234. Law: IT07 s AA 2; INT s 5  ¶1-070 Case law The interpretation of any Act of Parliament often gives rise to a dispute. A dispute regarding the operation of tax law is resolved through the statutory challenge procedures set out in the Tax Administration Act 1994. See Chapter 4. A large number of tax cases have been decided over the years. Those cases give a good indication of how a section applies in relation to a particular problem. For example, there are many cases on the general permission and general limitations sections found in ss DA 1–DA 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the general anti-avoidance sections. Even though it is hoped that the interpretation of tax legislation has been simplified through the rewriting of the Income Tax Act, case law remains an essential tool to its interpretation. In fact, ss BD 3(3) and BD 4(3) specifically require persons to have regard to case law when determining the time income is derived or when expenditure or loss is incurred. Law: IT07 ss BD 3(3), BD 4(3)  PERSONS LIABLE FOR INCOME TAX ¶1-080 Tax year Income tax is imposed on the taxable income of a taxpayer for each tax year. A tax year runs from 1 April to the following 31 March. The  tax years are numbered according to the years in which that 31 March falls. For example, the 2013–14 tax year is the tax year ending on 31 March 2014. Although the tax year is from 1 April to 31 March, some taxpayers who have an accounting balance date other than 31 March may treat the year ending on their balance date as their tax year for the purpose of determining their business income. This period is referred to as an income year: see ¶2-055. Law: IT07 s YA 1  ¶1-090 Imposition of income tax Section BB 1 is the charging provision that imposes income tax on a person’s taxable income. This taxable income for any tax year is determined by offsetting any available net losses against the person’s net income. A person’s net income is determined by reference to annual gross income less annual total deduction. In other words, individual sources of income can only be identified at the gross level of the tax calculation. See ¶2-105. The way in which s BB 1 applies may be illustrated by reference to a person who derived income from two sources: salary and New Zealand superannuation. Example: A person took the view that tax at the appropriate rate should be imposed on each item of income separately. This method produced a lower tax burden than if the tax payable had been calculated on the sum total of all items of income. The Taxation Review Authority rejected the person’s method. Income tax is imposed on the year’s income as an accumulated sum and not on each item of income separately. See Case D45 (1980) 4 NZTC 60,763.  See also Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 9, November 1996 at 27. However, certain categories of income, called schedular income, are subject to separate income tax calculations to ensure conformity with the gross/global concept underlying the legislation. See ¶2-105. Law: IT07 s BB 1  ¶1-100 Who pays tax? Every person is liable for income tax. A “person” is defined in the Interpretation Act 1999 to include a corporation sole, a body corporate, and an unincorporated body. The term “taxpayer” is used to mean a “person” who is, or may be, liable to perform or comply with an obligation imposed by the Income Tax Act 2007. Consequently, an individual (ie a natural person), a company (including any body corporate, not only those incorporated under the Companies Act 1993), a local or public authority and a trust (the actual liability being imposed on the trustee or trustees) are all taxpayers, liable to pay income tax on income derived by them. See Guy v C of IR (2003) 21 NZTC 18,269 and Keighley v C of IR (2004) 21 NZTC 18,461. In C of IR v Rupe (2003) 21 NZTC 18,129, the District Court rejected the taxpayer’s argument that he was not subject to New Zealand tax by virtue of the Treaty of Waitangi, the New Zealand Bill of Rights and his status as a Christian. This decision was affirmed by the High Court in Rupe v C of IR (2004) 21 NZTC 18,519. Law: IT07 ss BB 2, YA 1; INT s 30  ¶1-110 The source doctrine A New Zealand resident (see ¶1-120) is liable for tax on all assessable income, whether derived from New Zealand or overseas. A non-resident is liable for New Zealand income tax only on income that is derived from New Zealand. The effect of these two qualifications is that only New Zealand residents and New Zealandsourced income are liable for New Zealand income tax. For this reason, there is a carefully drafted and complex definition of “New Zealand” for tax purposes. The effect of the extended definition is to enlarge New Zealand’s tax jurisdiction to cover many of the mineral exploration activities carried out off the New Zealand coast. See ¶5139 and ¶5-144. Law: IT07 s YD 4  ¶1-120 Residence — Individual In New Zealand, a person’s liability to income tax depends on the person’s residence status. The concept of residence for tax purposes is based mainly on the “permanent place of abode” test or on a quantitative test. Whether a taxpayer is a New Zealand resident is important for a number of tax-related matters, including: ▪ the international tax regime ▪ dividend imputation ▪ non-resident withholding tax ▪ foreign superannuation schemes ▪ double tax treaties ▪ tax rates, and ▪ foreign losses. Individuals The rules for determining an individual’s residence for tax purposes are: ▪ The permanent place of abode test: a natural person is deemed to be a New Zealand resident if that person has a permanent place of abode here, whether or not that person also has a permanent place of abode overseas. ▪ The government service rule: any natural person who is personally absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government in any capacity is deemed to be resident in New Zealand during that absence. Example:  A public servant continues to be liable to New Zealand income tax on any salary paid to him or her while posted overseas. Similarly, any interest or dividends received by a public servant is subject to tax in the usual manner.  Although these people are liable to New Zealand tax as well as overseas tax, New Zealand gives credit for the overseas tax against the New Zealand tax. This does not apply if the relevant double tax agreement provides otherwise. ▪ The 183-day test: a natural person who is present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in aggregate in any 12-month period is deemed to be a resident from the first day of presence. (This will be the case even if the person concerned does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand.) ▪ The 325-day test: to cease New Zealand residency, a natural person must be absent from New Zealand for a period or periods exceeding in aggregate 325 days in any 12-month period. Non-residence commences from the first day of absence. Note that from 30 June 2014, the retrospective application of the day count rules no longer applies for GST purposes. To be resident, a person must be present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total, over a 12-month period. For GST purposes, the person will be treated as being tax resident from the first day after the 183-day period has been exceeded. Similarly, to be considered non-resident, a person must be outside New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12-month period and, for GST purposes, the resident will be regarded as non-resident from the first day after the 325-day period has been exceeded. The permanent place of abode test takes precedence over all the other provisions. Consequently, a natural person whose permanent place of abode is in New Zealand remains a tax resident despite an absence from New Zealand of more than 325 days in a 12-month period. Equally, a natural person who is present in New Zealand for  less than 183 days in a 12-month period is still resident if they have a permanent place of abode here. Note it has been clarified that the natural person residency test continues to apply to natural persons acting in the capacity of trustees following the introduction of s YA 5 relating to trustee capacity (see ¶25-025). ▸ Note: Impact of COVID-19 virus on 183-day test Inland Revenue has stated that a person will not become New Zealand tax resident under the 183-day test because he or she is not able to leave New Zealand as a result of COVID-19 issues. This position will apply provided the person leaves New Zealand within a reasonable time after they are no longer practically restricted in travelling. The additional days spent in New Zealand will not count towards the 183-day test. Example Jane was visiting New Zealand on an extended holiday as the guest of a friend. She had been present in New Zealand for 170 days in a 12-month period when, under the COVID-19 emergency, she became stranded in New Zealand. She was advised that she could not fly home. For the purpose of the day test, she will remain fixed at 170 days for the period from when she is unable to leave New Zealand up to and including the day when she departs. That is, so long as she leaves New Zealand after a reasonable number of days from when she is no longer practically restricted in travelling, Jane has not become tax resident in New Zealand. Jane plans to leave as soon as she is able. Example adapted from Inland Revenue, “COVID-Your questions answered”, 23 April 2020  Permanent place of abode The concept of “permanent place of abode” for the purposes of s YD 1 is not defined in the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act). The Act does, however, envisage the possibility of an individual having a permanent place of abode in more than one country, as s YD 1 requires the person to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, “even if they also have a permanent place of abode elsewhere”.  Background to current position In March 2014, the Commissioner released an interpretation statement, IS 14/01: “Tax Residence”, explaining the residence rules (see Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 3, April 2014, at 6). IS 14/01 replaced earlier items on tax residence and applied from 1 April 2014. An accompanying statement set out the Commissioner’s transitional operational position for situations where a taxpayer’s residence status may have changed under IS 14/01 from that under previous statements by the Commissioner (see Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 3, April 2014, at 3). However, the validity of the Commissioner’s approach in IS 14/01 was cast into doubt following the Court of Appeal decision in C of IR v Diamond (2015) 27 NZTC ¶22-035, discussed below. As a consequence of the court’s decision, the Commissioner released a further interpretation statement, IS 16/03, which updated and replaced IS 14/01. This statement is also discussed below. Diamond decision In Case 10/2013 (2013) 26 NZTC ¶2-009, the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) held that a taxpayer who had a rental property available to him was resident in New Zealand, even though he had never lived in the property. The decision was successfully appealed by the taxpayer in Diamond v C of IR (2014) 26 NZTC ¶21-093. The Commissioner then appealed to the Court of Appeal in C of IR v Diamond (2015) 27 NZTC ¶22-035. The Court of Appeal dismissed the Commissioner’s appeal and upheld Clifford J’s conclusion in the High Court that the mere fact that an individual has a dwelling available to him or her in New Zealand will not, by itself, mean the person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand and is resident in New Zealand for tax purposes. The Court of Appeal’s judgment restricts the application of former TRA case law on the residence of individuals and provides guidance on how the statutory residence test is to be applied. The Court held:  ▪ The relevant property (the Waikato Esplanade property) had never been Mr Diamond’s home and it was never intended by him to be his home. He had never lived in that property and had only ever used it as an investment. A place in which Mr Diamond had never lived could not constitute a dwelling with which he had enduring and permanent ties. ▪ Although Mr Diamond had other ongoing personal connections with New Zealand, the only address advanced by the Commissioner as a permanent place of abode for Mr Diamond was the Waikato Esplanade property. These connections must be focused on the alleged permanent place of abode to have significance for s OE 1 (now s YD 1 of the Act). If that property did not carry any of the characteristics of a permanent place of abode, other connections would not alter that conclusion. ▪ The TRA’s decision in Case Q55 was not authority for the Commissioner’s proposition that the mere availability of a dwelling was sufficient to ground an assessment of factual connections to the property, even if it had not been used by the taxpayer as a dwelling previously. Statutory interpretation ▪ The plain meaning of the words “permanent place of abode in New Zealand”, coupled with the statutory context, demonstrated that the phrase meant something more than mere availability of a place to stay and implied actual usage of the property by the taxpayer for residential purposes. ▪ The consequence of having tax residence in New Zealand was that all the taxpayer’s worldwide income was taxable in New Zealand, subject to any applicable double taxation arrangements. This could result in serious implications for the taxpayer and suggested that an interpretation beyond the ordinary and natural meaning of the term “permanent place of abode” ought not to be adopted unless plainly indicated by the statutory language or the context.  Correct interpretation of s OE 1 (now s YD 1) ▪ Whether an individual has a permanent place of abode is a question of fact. ▪ What is required is an overall assessment as to whether the taxpayer has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. This will be highly contextual and will naturally turn on the circumstances of each case. ▪ The determination cannot be separated into discrete questions. Rather, the approach calls for an integrated factual assessment, directed to determining the nature and quality of the use the taxpayer habitually makes of a particular place of abode. ▪ In this assessment, the mere availability to the taxpayer of a dwelling is not sufficient by itself. Nor, as Case Q55 demonstrated, will the mere unavailability of the dwelling necessarily result in loss of status as a resident taxpayer. ▪ The following (non-exhaustive) factors may inform the inquiry: □ the continuity or otherwise of the taxpayer’s presence in New Zealand and in the dwelling □ the duration of that presence □ the durability of the taxpayer’s association with the particular place □ the closeness or otherwise of the taxpayer’s connection with the dwelling (the situation before and after a period or periods of absence from New Zealand should be considered) □ the requirement for permanency is to distinguish merely transient or temporary places of abode  □ permanency refers to the continuing availability of a place on an indefinite (but not necessarily everlasting) basis, and □ the existence of another permanent place of abode outside New Zealand does not preclude a finding that the taxpayer has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. ▪ In assessing a particular case, the factual inquiry will be on the tax years in question. However, evidence of the relevant circumstances both before and after those tax years may be taken into account to the extent they bear upon the question whether the taxpayer had a permanent place of abode in New Zealand in the tax years in question. ▪ The focus is on whether the taxpayer, not members of the taxpayer’s family, has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. Accordingly, the fact that a taxpayer may provide a home for his family in circumstances where the taxpayer lives elsewhere would not necessarily be sufficient to establish that the taxpayer had a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. Van Uden The Court of Appeal applied Diamond in Van Uden v C of IR (2018) 28 NZTC ¶23-081 to conclude that a sea captain employed by a foreign merchant shipping fleet had a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. When not working overseas, the taxpayer was present in New Zealand for several months in each of the tax years in question (2005–2009). During those tax years he and his wife, while present in New Zealand, lived at a dwelling owned by their trust. The trust also owned rental properties in New Zealand that were originally owned by the taxpayer and his wife operating as a partnership. At all times during and after the relevant tax years, the trust’s dwelling was indefinitely available for the taxpayer and his wife to use whenever they returned to New Zealand. Credit card records showed that everyday living expenses the couple incurred were consistent with living at the dwelling and the taxpayer’s mail was  sent to him at that address. The taxpayer’s salary went to meet the trust’s loan obligations, insurance, utilities and related expenses (although neither he nor his wife had New Zealand bank accounts). The Court of Appeal ruled that the taxpayer had a permanent place of abode at the trust’s dwelling for the tax years in dispute. Although the taxpayer did not own the dwelling directly, he had an interest in it via the trust, of which he was both a trustee and a beneficiary. There was an ongoing and close association with the property throughout. The Court noted that ownership of the property in a trust structure did not take away from the fact that the taxpayer had availed himself of the property and made it his home. Commissioner’s statement In June 2016, the Commissioner released an interpretation statement, IS 16/03: “Tax residence” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 10, October 2016 at 2), which updated and replaced IS 14/01. The updated section covers the permanent place of abode test and takes into account the Court of Appeal’s decision in Diamond. The key aspect of the interpretation statement that was changed as a result of the Diamond decision was the emphasis on the nature and quality of the use a person habitually makes of their place of abode in New Zealand. Simply having a dwelling in New Zealand will not be sufficient. The statement acknowledges that the term “permanent place of abode” does not have a defined meaning, but that it has been described by the Court of Appeal as meaning “a place where a taxpayer habitually resides from time to time even if they spend periods of time overseas”. The statement states that the permanent place of abode test will usually be considered in a situation where someone who has habitually resided at a dwelling in New Zealand has left New Zealand for a time. In that situation, the question is whether they can be regarded as “continuing to habitually reside” at their place of abode in New Zealand, despite a period or periods of absence, such that it can be considered to still be their permanent place of abode. The test can also be relevant when someone who was not a New  Zealand tax resident, and who has not become resident under the 183-day rule, establishes a place of abode here. The question in that scenario is whether, and at what point, the person can be considered to have “begun habitually residing” at their abode here, such that it can be considered to be their permanent place of abode (irrespective of whether they also have a permanent place of abode outside New Zealand). On the Court of Appeal’s decision in Diamond, the statement states that in that case the taxpayer had never resided, or intended to reside, in his dwelling in New Zealand. The dwelling had only ever been used as an investment property. In those circumstances, the Court considered that the dwelling could not be the taxpayer’s permanent place of abode, irrespective of any of the ties he had to New Zealand. Because there was simply no question about whether the taxpayer habitually resided in the dwelling before he left New Zealand (he did not), there could be no question about whether he continued to habitually reside there during the tax years in question (the first four years of his absence from New Zealand). As such, the Court did not need to analyse and weigh up the nature and extent of each of the connections the taxpayer had to New Zealand. No matter how strong the taxpayer’s connections to New Zealand were, because he did not have any residential connections to the dwelling at all, none of his connections to New Zealand could indicate that the dwelling was a permanent place of abode for him. On any overall assessment of the taxpayer’s circumstances, the property was not a permanent place of abode for him before or after his departure. IS 16/03 contains a discussion of each of the factors highlighted by the Court of Appeal, as well as a number of examples that illustrate the way in which a person’s overall circumstances need to be considered to determine if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. In summary: A person must have a place of abode (ie a dwelling) in New Zealand to have a permanent place of abode here. But simply having a dwelling is not sufficient, and would not give rise to tax residence in New Zealand.  A place of abode will be a person’s permanent place of abode if it is a place where they habitually reside from time to time, even if they spend periods of time overseas. To be a permanent place of abode, the abode must be a place where the person habitually resides on an enduring, rather than temporary, basis. Deciding if a dwelling is someone’s permanent place of abode requires an overall assessment of the person’s circumstances and the nature and quality of the use the person habitually makes of the place of abode. In determining whether a place of abode is a person’s permanent place of abode, it is necessary to consider the continuity and duration of the person’s presence in New Zealand and the durability of the person’s association with their place of abode here and how close their connection with it is. To determine whether a person has a durable association with their place of abode, the person’s overall connections with their place of abode and with New Zealand must be weighed up. It is then necessary to evaluate the extent to which those connections indicate the person has an enduring relationship with their place of abode here, such that it can be considered to be their permanent place of abode. It does not matter how strong a person’s ties to New Zealand are if those ties do not indicate the particular dwelling in question is a permanent place of abode for the person. For example, if a person has strong connections to New Zealand, but the only dwelling they have here is a property that they have never lived in and never intend to live in, that property could not be a permanent place of abode for them. In addition, IS 16/03 contains a flowchart, which sets out the matters to be considered in establishing if an individual is tax resident in New Zealand, and shows the interrelationship between the various residence tests for individuals.  Transitional provision As a result of the Commissioner’s updated position on what is required to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, there may be some situations in which the application of the new interpretation statement IS 16/03 gives a different result from the application of IS 14/01. Inland Revenue has issued a transitional operational position that confirms that as the legal analysis in IS 16/03 represents the correct view of the law, taxpayers can ask Inland Revenue to apply the analysis contained in the interpretation statement to tax positions taken in earlier years. All requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis using the approach in the standard practice statement on s 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (SPS 16/01 — Requests to amend assessments (replaced by SPS 20/03 with effect from 2 June 2020)). The transitional operational position is published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 10, October 2016 at 61. Note that the Commissioner’s position in relation to taxpayers who relied on the analysis in “Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) Rules 1989: New Residence Rules” (Public Information Bulletin No 180, June 1989) in periods before 1 April 2014 can be found in the transitional operational position issued in conjunction with IS 14/01 (see Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 3, April 2014 at 3). Law: IT07 s YD 1  ¶1-140 Residence — company The rules relating to the residence of a company encompass four independent tests. There are no tests for non-residence, which would seem to imply that a resident company may become nonresident only if it fails to meet the residence tests on an ongoing basis. The four tests are: ▪ Is the company incorporated in New Zealand? ▪ Does the company have its head office in New Zealand?  ▪ Does the company have its centre of management in New Zealand? ▪ Is control of the company by its directors, acting in their capacity as directors, exercised in New Zealand, whether or not the decision making by directors is confined to New Zealand? A company is resident in New Zealand if it satisfies any of the four tests; therefore, companies incorporated outside New Zealand may be affected. The Commissioner has recently set out her position on the corporate residence tests in interpretation statement, IS 16/03: “Tax residence” (which updated and replaced IS 14/01), Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 10, October 2016 at 2. Note it has been clarified that the natural person residency test continues to apply to natural persons acting in the capacity of trustees following the introduction of s YA 5 relating to trustee capacity (see ¶25-025). Place of incorporation test This is an objective and easily ascertainable test of corporate residence: a company is resident if it has been through a process of incorporation in New Zealand. A company incorporated under the Companies Act 1993 would be resident here. This test obviously cannot apply to companies that are not capable of being incorporated, such as a unit trust. However, companies that cannot be incorporated may be resident under one of the other tests. Head office test The Commissioner considers that “office” in the context of the head office test means a physical place from where the business is conducted; a place where the administration and management (in the broadest sense) of a business is carried out. The head office of a company is the office that is above all others: the place of administration and management that is superior to all others. It is the office from which the business of the company is directed and  carried on. An office will be superior to other offices of the company if individuals working in those other offices are responsible to individuals located in that office. The focus of the test is therefore on a physical place, in the sense of a building, from which the overall operations of the company are directed and carried on. In determining whether a company has its head office in New Zealand the following factors may be relevant: ▪ The location of senior management staff. ▪ Where the major strategic and policy decisions are made. ▪ Whether specialised functions, for example of an advisory nature, are carried out in a particular office. ▪ Whether the staff of the company consider that an office is the head office. Centre of management test The focus of the test is on the centre of management of the company as a whole, not the management of only part of a company’s operations. In determining where the centre of management of a company as a whole is, acts of management at various levels may be relevant (see Vinelight Nominees Ltd v C of IR (2013) 26 NZTC ¶21-055). The focus is on where the company’s centre of management is as a matter of fact (NZ Forest Products Finance NV v C of IR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,073). The test is not limited to consideration of the company’s formal management structures, such as those set out in corporate governance documents. The test focuses on how the company is managed in reality, even if that conflicts with the governance documents or formal structures. This test focuses on the centre of management of the entire company. Therefore, if a company that operates in several countries has a centre of management in New Zealand, but that centre of management only relates to the company’s New Zealand operations,  the company will not be resident here under the centre of management test. Note that although a company may well satisfy both the head office and centre of management tests, the focus of the two tests is different. The head office test concentrates on a physical place, ie on an office that constitutes a company’s highest office. By contrast, the focus of the centre of management test is not on identifying the quality of a particular office, but rather on the broader question of whether the management of a company is centred in New Zealand. A company does not need to have an office in New Zealand to satisfy the centre of management test. Director control test For the purposes of this test, director includes de facto directors. Any person carrying out the duties of a director is a director, whether the title is used. A person is also a director if those occupying the position of directors are accustomed to act in accordance with the person’s directions or instructions. The definition also extends to entities that do not have directors in the conventional sense. In those cases, a person who acts in the same or similar way to the way a director would act is treated as a director. For example, the manager of a unit trust is a director because they are involved in making the major decisions for the unit trust. The director control test focuses on where the directors exercise their directorial control of the company from, ie the place from which the strategic and policy decisions are made. A company will be resident in New Zealand under this test if directors are effectively controlling the company from New Zealand, ie if the central and directing mind of the company is here. The test is only satisfied if directors acting in their capacity as directors exercise control from New Zealand. If directors control a company from New Zealand in their capacity as shareholders, but not in their capacity as directors, the company will not be resident here under the director control test. The director control test is satisfied if control of a company is exercised in New Zealand, whether or not decision-making by directors is confined to New Zealand.  The fact that directors of a company exercise directorial functions from New Zealand does not necessarily mean that control of the company by its directors is exercised from New Zealand. For example, if the directors ordinarily exercise their powers in the course of directors’ meetings held in Australia, the fact that New Zealand directors occasionally sign resolutions in New Zealand or occasionally participate in telephone conferences from New Zealand does not mean that the directors are exercising control of the company from New Zealand. See Case 11/2011 (2011) 25 NZTC ¶1011. In practice, it may be difficult to determine whether the nominated directors of a company are acting under directions or instructions from another person or are merely influenced but not controlled by another person. A majority shareholder, for example a parent company, will normally influence to some extent the actions of the company in which it is a shareholder. However, if the majority shareholder only exercises the powers that such a shareholder would have in general meetings — for example, to appoint and dismiss members of the board, and to approve and initiate changes to the financial structure of the company — then that shareholder will not be controlling the company in terms of the director control test. By contrast, if the majority shareholder assumes the functions of the company’s board, or if that board merely “rubber stamps” decisions made by the majority shareholder without independent consideration being given to the decisions, the majority shareholder will be a director of the company under the definition in the Act. IS 16/03 contains a number of examples illustrating the application of the company residence tests. Impact of COVID-19 virus on corporate residency test Inland Revenue has stated that the COVID-19 pandemic will generally not cause corporate taxpayers to be tax resident in New Zealand because directors of a company are confined or stranded in New Zealand. Example  Tony’s Technology Ltd is incorporated overseas and was not tax resident in New Zealand before the COVID-19 emergency. Directors Tony, Tina and Terry are stranded in New Zealand and have been arranging board meetings online with Tim, who is overseas. The reason for holding the board meetings with three directors in New Zealand is because of COVID-19 and the inability to travel. Neither directors’ control nor centre of management have changed to New Zealand because of the emergency conditions. Tony’s Technology Ltd does not have tax residence in New Zealand. Tony, Tina and Terry will leave New Zealand as soon as they are able. Example from Inland Revenue, “COVID-19 - Your questions answered”, 23 April 2020  Law: IT07 s YD 2(1)  ¶1-150 Brief summary of double tax agreements The New Zealand Government has entered into a number of treaties with the governments of other countries for the purpose of avoiding double taxation. These treaties are referred to as double tax agreements (DTAs). They are aimed at the situation in which a resident of one country derives income that has a source either wholly or partly in another country. Generally, income tax would be payable in both countries on the same income — in the taxpayer’s home country because he or she is a resident there, and in the other country because that is the source from where the income is wholly or partly derived. A DTA is designed to attribute income to one country or the other in this type of situation. The agreement allocates taxing jurisdiction between the respective governments. DTAs can also deal with the procedures governing the exchange of information between the revenue authorities of different countries, although sometimes these are separate agreements. A DTA is paramount over the tax law that has been enacted in New Zealand. See s BH 1(4). This enables income to be taxed pursuant to the treaty and irrespective of the treatment required by the domestic law. Example: The Income Tax Act 2007 imposes tax on certain non-imputed dividends at a rate of 30% of the gross amount of the dividend payment (s RF 8). However, most DTAs to  which New Zealand is a party limit to 15% the maximum tax New Zealand may impose on dividends paid to residents of the other treaty country. This means that dividends paid to residents of treaty countries are taxed at a 15% rate and dividends paid to residents of other countries are taxed at a 30% rate.  Law: IT07 s BH 1  MEANING OF INCOME ¶1-163 Concept of assessable income Assessable income is defined by reference to the various parts of the Act which classify amounts as income (not being exempt income or excluded income or non-residents’ foreign-sourced income: see ¶1-165 and ¶1-170) and which are allocated to the tax year. For example, subpart CB expressly includes as income amounts derived from a business, certain personal property, land transactions, the sale of timber, minerals and patent rights, the transfer of employment obligations on the sale of a business and property obtained by theft. See ss CB 1–CB 14 and CB 24–CB 34. There is also a catch-all provision that includes as income amounts that are income according to ordinary concepts. See s CA 1(1). Many of the items included as income throughout the Act are receipts which would obviously be regarded as income in the ordinary sense, eg amounts from a business, s CB 1; interest, s CC 3; dividends, s CD 1; employment or service income, s CE 1; and so on. Other items are less obviously income, eg amounts received from the sale of land in certain circumstances or a payment for the goodwill of a business derived by the owner of land from a lease. In addition, a good deal of case law has developed in New Zealand and elsewhere specifying what types of receipt are income and what are not. Generally, a receipt of a capital nature, such as an amount received from the sale of a substantial asset, is not income while amounts received on a regular and organised basis, such as from the conduct of business, are income. There is nothing sacred about the concept of income, however, and, if the Act is explicit in bringing  particular amounts in as income, these are included in the tax calculation for those persons who have derived them. See ¶5-162. Law: IT07 ss BD 1, CA 1  ¶1-165 Concept of exempt income Certain types of income are expressly treated as “exempt income” by specific provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007. For example, income received by the TAB NZ (before 1 August 2020, Racing Industry Transition Agency) is exempt income. See s CW 47(1)(a). When a person derives both exempt income and assessable income, that person’s taxable income for the year is calculated with reference to assessable income only. See ¶5-598. Law: IT07 subpart CW, ss BD 1(2), CA 2(2)  ¶1-170 Concept of excluded income Certain types of income are expressly treated as “excluded income” by specific provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007. For example, a fringe benefit received by an employee is excluded income of the employee: see s CX 3. Excluded income is omitted from a person’s calculation of income tax for an income year. Law: IT07 subpart CX, ss BD 1(3), CA 2(3)  ¶1-180 Business income — trading stock In the case of business income, there are specific provisions dealing with trading stock. If any person owns or carries on business, the value of the person’s trading stock at the beginning and the end of every income year is taken into account in calculating the person’s net income or net loss for that year. See s EB 3. The value of a person’s trading stock at the end of an income year is income for the income year and the value of opening stock is allowed as a deduction for that year. See s EA 1(2), (3). This is in  accordance with accounting practice, but other provisions dealing with trading stock have effects that do not necessarily follow from the rules of accounting. Example: If TP disposes of trading stock during the year for less than its market price or true value, it is not the actual price received by the taxpayer that is brought in as income in that year but the market price or true value. See s GC 1(1) and ¶9-087.  See ¶9-010. Law: IT07 subpart EB, s EA 1  ¶1-190 The derivation of income Income tax is an annual tax imposed on a person’s taxable income for each year. This means that it is necessary to determine for which year income (and deductions) should be allocated. See ss BD 3 and BD 4. Unless the amount of income is subject to a timing regime under Pt C or Pts E–I, income is allocated to the income year in which it is derived. See s BD 3(2). At first glance, there would seem to be no difficulty with this, because the year’s income is simply the total of all income items actually received by the person during the year. So long as the person can add up all salary payments, interest and dividends, etc, between 1 April and the following 31 March, there would seem to be no room for doubt. However, it is not always obvious when many types of income are derived. When income is derived is generally based on ordinary accounting principles. Business accounting operates on an accrual system whereby items are regarded as income when they become owing, not when they are actually paid. This is the approach adopted for income tax purposes in the type of case outlined above. There are a number of rules in the Act for determining when particular types of receipt are derived, as well as much case law developed on this question. See ¶5-075. The issue is important, because the allocation of income to one particular year instead of another often affects not  only the time at which the person must pay tax on it but also the amount of the tax to be paid. Law: IT07 s BD 3  DEDUCTIONS ¶1-220 Deductions defined A person’s tax liability is calculated by determining all assessable income for a particular income year (annual gross income) and subtracting from that figure all deductions for the year (annual total deductions). Only those deductions which are expressly authorised by the Act may be made in calculating a person’s tax liability. If a taxpayer wishes to claim a particular deduction, the taxpayer must be able to point to a provision in the Act that allows it. General permission Briefly, the general permission provides that an amount of expenditure or loss is deductible to the extent to which it is: ▪ incurred in deriving the taxpayer’s assessable income or excluded income or a combination of those types of income, or ▪ incurred in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income or excluded income or a combination of those types of income. A taxpayer is also allowed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss, provided one of the above criteria is met. In order for expenditure or losses to be allowed as a deduction, they must relate directly to the derivation of assessable income, excluded income or a combination of both. Example: If a taxpayer derives income from rents, he or she is allowed a deduction for the expenses incurred in deriving that income, such as rates on the premises,  maintenance, depreciation and outgoings.  For a deduction to be allowed as being incurred in the course of carrying on a business, the expenditure or loss must relate directly to the business but need not necessarily relate to any particular item of assessable or excluded income. It is only necessary that the person shows that the business in which the expenditure or loss was incurred was carried on for the purpose of deriving assessable or excluded income. See ¶10-021. There are a number of general limitations which restrict the general permission (see ¶1-221) and other more specific rules which may supplement or override the general permission (for example, deductions for taxes, revenue account property, bad debts and research and development). Section DA 3 clarifies the effect of a specific rule on the general permission and the general limitations; see ¶10-016. Loss The reference to “loss” (as well as “expenditure”) in the general permission is designed to cover the situation where no actual expenditure is incurred by the taxpayer but the taxpayer suffers a loss. The writing off of a bad debt, for example, involves no expenditure of the amount written off, but that amount could be described as a loss. A distinction is made between this type of loss and loss as in the context of a negative result from a year’s trading. The core provisions have distinguished the two terms by including a reference to “net loss” — applicable where the result of the income calculation is a negative figure. Law: IT07 ss BD 2, DA 1, DA 3  ¶1-221 Summary of general limitations for deductions No deduction is allowed for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent that it is: ▪ of a capital nature (the capital limitation)  ▪ of a private nature (the private limitation) ▪ incurred in deriving exempt income (the exempt income limitation) ▪ incurred in deriving income from employment (the employment limitation) ▪ incurred in deriving non-resident passive income (the withholding tax limitation) ▪ incurred in deriving non-residents’ foreign-sourced income (the non-residents’ foreign-sourced income limitation). The general limitations override the general permission (see ¶1220). The most important general limitation is the capital limitation. See ¶10-071. Many cases have involved argument over the question of whether particular types of expenditure were of a capital nature and therefore not allowed as a deduction. See, for example, Auckland Gas Co Ltd v C of IR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,702 (PC). Law: IT07 s DA 2  ¶1-250 Employment expenses Apart from those expenses incurred in determining a person’s tax liability (ie for the preparation of income tax or GST returns under s DB 3(1)) certain loss of earnings and/or profits, insurance premiums and expenses relating to the derivation of income subject to withholding tax, no other deduction is allowed in deriving income from employment. However, independent contractors (eg real estate sales persons) who do not derive any “income from employment” can still deduct expenditure incurred in deriving assessable or excluded income. “Income from employment” includes salary or wages or an extra pay. It also includes salary or wages or other income derived by  shareholder-employees of close companies. However, the salary or wages or an extra pay are not included as income from employment to the extent that they are made: ▪ to a self-employed person (as defined in s 2 of the Accident Compensation Act 1982) ▪ to an earner, in respect of compensation for loss of earnings other than as an employee (as defined under regulations made under s 167 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992), or ▪ to a self-employed person (within the meaning of s 13 of the Accident Insurance Act 1998 or s 6 of the Accident Compensation Act 2001) in respect of earner compensation paid after the first week of incapacity. Law: IT07 ss DA 2(4), DB 3, YA 1  ¶1-260 Depreciation loss Although s DA 2(1) prohibits a deduction for capital expenditure or losses, a deduction is permitted under s DA 1(1) in respect of the depreciation of capital equipment that is used or is available for use in the production of assessable or excluded income or carrying on a business. This type of deduction is referred to in the Income Tax Act 2007 as a “depreciation loss”. Depreciation is not actually an expenditure or loss; it is an allowance, given in recognition of the fact that equipment wears out and eventually must be replaced. Depreciation effectively allows the cost of capital equipment to be written off, ie progressively deducted over the life of the asset. The capital limitation does not apply to an amount of depreciation loss merely because the item of property being depreciated is itself of a capital nature. Depreciation rates for assets are set by the Commissioner in accordance with statutory criteria. See ¶13-010 et seq. Law: IT07 subpart EE, ss DA 1, DA 2(1), DA 4  ¶1-270 Repairs Expenditure on repairs and maintenance is deductible under the ordinary provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007. Expenditure must satisfy the test under s DA 1 and is subject to the denial of a deduction for capital expenditure. Although capital expenditure is not deductible, it is subject to the normal depreciation rules. See ¶10840. Examples of expenditure that would qualify for deductions for repairs are the replacement of a worn washer on a household tap, and the replacement of a spent battery or a corroded exhaust system. See the judgment of Nicholls LJ in Auckland Gas Co Ltd v C of IR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,702 (PC). Law: IT07 s DA 1  ¶1-280 Incentive deductions — tax credits For economic and policy reasons, the Government, from time to time, encourages or assists various types of taxpayers or business activities by granting incentive deductions. An incentive deduction takes the form of a deduction from annual gross income, leaving income tax to be calculated on the resulting net income figure. For example, a taxpayer in business is allowed a deduction for certain capital expenditure incurred to avoid, remedy or mitigate the detrimental effects of the discharge of contaminants. See ¶10-242. In contrast, an incentive tax credit takes the form of a reduction of the tax that otherwise would have to be paid for the income year. Government assistance may also take the form of a grant or loan. The grant or loan is not income for tax purposes and limitations are imposed on the deduction for expenditure covered by the grant or loan. See ¶10-513. Special treatment is also provided for the film industry: see ¶10-446.  ¶1-300 Brief summary of timing of deductions  Any deductions available under the Act must be allocated to an income year in accordance with s BD 4. Generally, a deduction must be allocated to the income year in which it is incurred, unless it is subject to a timing regime under any of Pts D–I. It does not matter that the income to which the expenditure or loss relates may be included in the taxpayer’s assessable income in some other year, either earlier or later. What is required is that the expenditure or loss must have been incurred in the year for which it is claimed as a deduction. Generally, expenditure is regarded as incurred when the taxpayer actually becomes liable to pay it. That is not necessarily when the taxpayer actually pays the amount. It is often before that and may even be after it. A loss is incurred when the transaction giving rise to the loss occurs. It is not sufficient that the taxpayer expects to have to pay a certain amount. Generally, this means that reserves set aside to meet expected expenditure of some sort are not deductible. See ¶10-040. Example: A company’s claim for a deduction of overhaul costs to be incurred in the future did not succeed because it had not “incurred” the expenditure. The company argued that the overhaul costs should be treated as a deductible reserve because the overhaul was required by statute and was in addition to regular repairs and maintenance that might be required from time to time. However, the Taxation Review Authority rejected this argument. See Case T14 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,087.  However, a deduction may be allowed for anticipated expenditure if an established pattern shows that there is a definitive commitment to the expenditure. See ¶10-040. Law: IT07 s BD 4  ANNUAL LOSSES ¶1-310 Dealing with losses Sometimes a taxpayer’s deductions for a year exceed his or her income for that year. This may reflect a real loss situation, such as  when the taxpayer is running a business that is not doing very well, or may be caused by other circumstances giving rise to a tax loss, even though the taxpayer may actually be ahead in cash terms for the year. The term “net loss” is used to cover all situations in which the income calculation results in a negative figure. Law: IT07 s BC 4(3)  ¶1-320 Net loss carried forward or carried back The Act sets out the circumstances in which a net loss may be carried forward to a later year and deducted from the net income of the taxpayer in that later year. Only losses made in taxable situations may be carried forward. Losses caused by such things as the sale of a private residence (when an amount from that sale would not be income) may not be carried forward. When a net loss is carried forward from one year to the next, it is treated as a deduction from the net income of the taxpayer in the next year. If there is not enough net income in the next year to absorb all the loss, or if there is another net loss, the balance is carried forward to the year after that, and so on until the loss is fully absorbed. This process is commonly referred to as an offset of losses. There is no time limit within which losses must be recouped or offset. An individual with a tax loss carried forward must file a tax return to keep the losses alive. Before the 2019–20 income year, losses could not be carried back to previous years. However, in April 2020 a temporary loss carry-back scheme was introduced to support taxpayers in dealing with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The scheme applies to losses incurred in the 2019–20 or 2020–21 income years and allows these losses to be carried back one year to be offset against profits made in the preceding income year and thereby receive a refund of the excess tax paid. Law: IT07 ss BC 4(4), IA 2(2), (3), IA 3(4), IA 4(1)(a)  ¶1-330 Brief summary of company loss treatment For a company taxpayer, there are additional requirements that must be met before the company may make a loss offset. Broadly, a loss company can carry forward and offset its net loss only where the tax benefit arising from the offset is obtained by at least 49% of the natural person shareholders who originally bore the net loss. Shareholding interests are determined by reference to minimum voting or market value interests, measured from the beginning of the year of loss to the end of the year of carry-forward. This period is called the “continuity period”. See ¶18-023–¶18-030. As in the case of an individual, a company could only carry a loss forward to a future income year before the 2019–20 income year. From that date, a temporary loss carry-back scheme applies to assist taxpayers dealing with the economic impact of COVID-19. Law: IT07 ss IA 3(2)(a), (4), IA 5  CALCULATION OF TAX ¶1-360 Common tax returns The Commissioner prescribes the form in which tax returns are to be made. A number of different forms are prescribed for different taxpayers. See further at ¶2-015. The most common are: ▪ form IR 3 for individuals ▪ form IR 4 for companies ▪ form IR 6 for trustees, and ▪ form IR 7 for partnerships and look-through companies. Inland Revenue (IR) also accepts computer-produced tax returns. With effect from 21 February 2017, the Commissioner may allow a person to provide the information required in a prescribed form in a  manner other than writing if the Commissioner is satisfied that it is appropriate in the circumstances. This change confirms that an Inland Revenue staff member can telephone a taxpayer regarding incorrectly completed forms and correct errors in those forms on the basis of their telephone discussion with them. In addition, before 1 April 2019, IR sent certain wage and salary earners pre-printed income statements setting out the total tax deductions made on their behalf for the income year. With effect from 1 April 2019, changes made intended to modernise the tax administration mean that IR now sends out pre-populated accounts to individuals earning reportable income that will become their returns when finalised. See ¶2-016. Law: TAA ss 33–36  ¶1-380 Determining the amount of tax payable Taxpayers must calculate and satisfy their income tax liabilities in accordance with the core provisions. The process that taxpayers other than non-filing taxpayers must follow is set out in ss BC 2–BC 8. To arrive at the actual income tax payable for any year, certain amounts must be determined, namely the annual gross income derived by the taxpayer for the year and the annual total deduction for that year. This includes general business and income-related deductions, as well as deductions for depreciation and incentives. Subject to any timing rules, these deductions are taken from the gross income figure to determine the net income or net loss for the year. Any net losses from previous years available for carry-forward are deducted from the net income to give rise to taxable income. The actual calculation can be shown as follows: [annual gross income] − [annual total deduction] = [net income or net loss] [net income or net loss] − [available tax loss] = [taxable income]  To calculate the gross tax payable (referred to as the unadjusted income tax liability), a taxpayer applies the basic tax rate for the particular tax year to the taxpayer’s taxable income. See s BC 6(1). A taxpayer’s final tax liability is satisfied by first applying any available tax credits (for tax paid or withheld) and then through the payment of terminal tax. See s BC 8. Any tax credits remaining after offset against the income tax liability are first set off against other income tax obligations in accordance with Pts L and M. See ¶1-400. Any remaining excess credits, subject to s LA 5, may be refunded by the Commissioner. See also ¶2-110. For non-filing taxpayers, the total tax already deducted at source is the year’s tax liability. See ¶2-105. Law: IT07 subpart BC  ¶1-400 Brief summary of tax credits Where a person has tax credits remaining after offset against his or her income tax liability, those remaining tax credits must be dealt with according to the rules under ss LA 5–LA 8. Tax credits fall into five broad categories. These, in order of their use, are: ▪ non-refundable credits ▪ credits for supplementary dividends ▪ credits for imputation credits ▪ R&D tax credits, and ▪ refundable credits. Non-refundable tax credits “Non-refundable tax credit” is defined in s YA 1 as including tax credits for independent earners under s LC 13, payroll donations, income tax paid or payable in relation to attributed controlled foreign  company income, certain policyholder credits and credits for investors in multi-rate portfolio investment entities (PIEs). Tax credits for foreign income tax paid are also included as nonrefundable tax credits. A person treated as resident in New Zealand for New Zealand income tax purposes may derive income from a source in an overseas country. In such a case, it is likely that that person paid income tax in the other country on the income that was derived there. Because the taxpayer is resident in New Zealand, the income must be included in his or her assessable income for New Zealand tax purposes even if tax was paid on it overseas. However, subject to the rules in s LA 5(1), the taxpayer is allowed a credit against his or her New Zealand tax to take account of the overseas tax paid. See ¶26-250. Non-refundable credits remaining after offset against a taxpayer’s income tax liability are extinguished. Credits for supplementary dividends A tax credit for a supplementary dividend arises under subpart LP when an imputation credit is attached by a company to a dividend paid to a non-resident shareholder. The company is entitled to a tax credit equal to the amount of the supplementary dividend. See ¶26500. Surplus tax credits for supplementary dividends may be made available to other companies in a wholly-owned group, or carried forward to the next tax year. Credits for imputation credits A person is required to include as assessable income the amount of any imputation credits received. The person is then entitled to a tax credit equal to the amount of the imputation credit. When a corporate shareholder has excess imputation credits for an income year the excess credits convert into a loss carry-forward. When an individual shareholder has excess New Zealand imputation credits for a tax year the surplus credits are carried forward to the next tax year. See the example in ¶17-010.  Research and development tax credits A R&D tax credit arises under subpart LY when a person performs certain R&D activities in New Zealand and their eligible R&D expenditure is $50,000 or more in a year. The tax credit is 15% of the person’s total eligible R&D expenditure, with the total expenditure subject to a maximum of $120m unless a higher cap has been approved. See ¶10-855. Carried forward R&D tax credits must be used before current year R&D tax credits. Surplus R&D tax credits are refunded, to a specified maximum, or carried forward. Refundable tax credits Refundable tax credits include those credits which arise from tax payments that have been made by or for the taxpayer (eg PAYE, provisional tax, resident withholding tax (RWT) and non-resident withholding tax (NRWT)). It also includes tax credits for families under the Working for Families package, retirement savings contribution tax (RSCT) paid, residential land withholding tax (RLWT) paid, R&D tax losses and tax credits related to personal service rehabilitation payments. Also included as refundable tax credits are Māori authority credits, certain payments of tax on an investor’s exit from a multi-rate PIE, tax credits for petroleum miners and tax credits for mineral miners. Order of use of refundable tax credits Pursuant to s LA 6, any remaining tax deductions from PAYE payments, provisional tax payments, tax credits for RWT, RSCT, RLWT, Māori authority and multi-rate PIEs credits must all be credited against the taxpayer’s tax liability in the following order: ▪ previous tax year’s unpaid tax liability (if any) and, if this amount exceeds the tax credit available, to the extent of the available credit ▪ unpaid tax liability for the following tax year or years (if any), and ▪ unpaid provisional tax for the following tax year or years (if any).  Any excess tax deductions not so credited must be refunded by the Commissioner as tax paid in excess. This does not apply to PAYE payments if the Commissioner considers that something in the relevant employment income information is incorrect. A tax deduction that is not credited or refunded because of an error in employment income information may be credited or refunded once the Commissioner is satisfied that the information is correct. See s LB 1(4). Any remaining tax credits for families under the Working for Families package, tax credits for charitable gifts and R&D loss tax credits are refundable under s LA 7 and any remaining tax credits for NRWT are treated as tax paid in excess and are refundable under s LA 8. The ordering rules in s LA 6 do not apply to these tax credits. As well as being refundable, the taxpayer has the option of transferring the tax credits to another tax type, tax period or taxpayer under Pt 10B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Law: IT07 ss BC 8, LA 4–LA 8, LB 1, YA 1  ¶1-410 Tax credits and double tax agreements A credit may be allowable for tax paid overseas under a double tax agreement entered into between the New Zealand Government and the government of the overseas country in which the taxpayer has paid tax. See ¶26-280. In most instances, any credit will be subject to New Zealand domestic law and must not exceed the amount of New Zealand tax that would be payable on the income. See ¶26255. Law: IT07 s BH 1  ¶1-420 Rates of tax The rates set out in sch 1 pt A are called the basic rates of tax. When the Government determines that the rates of tax should be altered, sch 1 is amended by an amendment Act to incorporate the new rates.  Company In the case of a company, a flat rate system is employed. This means that tax is imposed at the one rate of 28¢ in the dollar, no matter how large or small the company’s taxable income. See ¶50050. Individual In the case of an individual, a progressive rate system is employed. Under this system, the rate of tax increases as income increases. The rates for 2011–12 and subsequent tax years are set out at ¶50040. Tax bracket Only that part of total taxable income which falls into a particular income band is subject to tax at the rate appropriate to that band. This means that, although the rate of tax increases as income increases, the increased rate operates only on the amount of income that falls into the increased income band. Example: Joe has taxable income of $63,000. For the 2019–20 tax year the amount of tax he has to pay on that amount is as follows: $  $  Taxable income  63,000  Tax on  14,000  1,470  Tax on  34,000 (48,000 − 14,000)  5,950  Tax on  15,000 (63,000 − 48,000)  4,500  Tax payable at basic rates applying for the 2019–20 tax year  11,920  Law: IT07 sch 1 pt A  ¶1-430 Payment of tax  Once the income tax on a taxpayer’s taxable income for the tax year has been determined and any credits to which that taxpayer is entitled to for the year have been deducted from the tax figure, the actual tax liability of the taxpayer for the year has been arrived at. This is a person’s terminal tax liability for the tax year and must be paid to the Commissioner by prescribed due dates. See ¶22-235. All taxpayers pay tax in advance under either the PAYE (pay as you earn) system, the resident withholding tax system or the provisional tax system, with a balancing adjustment made after the end of the year when actual tax on the year’s income is worked out. Law: IT07 ss BC 8(3), RA 3, YA 1  OTHER TAXES ¶1-440 Introduction to other taxes Other taxes may be imposed in addition to income tax. Some of these taxes are derived from the income tax system, having a particular purpose in relation to that system. Others do not have that complementary character — for example, goods and services tax and accident compensation levies.  ¶1-450 Brief summary of fringe benefit tax Remuneration received by an employee from his or her employer in a cash form is subject to income tax in the hands of the employee. Generally, in the past, remuneration in a non-cash form was not subject to income tax. This led to widespread provision of non-cash benefits such as the use of a motor vehicle, low-interest loans and discounted merchandise. Fringe benefit tax is intended to reduce this practice by requiring an employer to pay the tax on the value of the fringe benefits enjoyed by his or her employees. See ¶21-010 et seq. Generally, fringe benefit tax is deductible to the employer. However, if the employer has tax losses, the provision of fringe benefits  represents a cash cost without the immediate benefit of a deduction. See ¶21-010. Law: IT07 s BE 1(4)  ¶1-490 Brief summary of goods and services tax Goods and services tax (GST) is a consumption tax imposed under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. It applies to the supply of goods and services in New Zealand, including imported goods and services. The tax is levied at the rate of 15% and is paid to Inland Revenue by all “registered persons” — basically, all persons who carry on a taxable activity such as a business. The amount of GST payable is calculated by deducting input tax (the GST component in supplies made to a registered person) from output tax (the GST component in supplies made by that person). See ¶32-010. Law: GST s 8(1)  RECORD-KEEPING ¶1-505 Taxpayer record-keeping obligations A business taxpayer is required to retain most business records, ie books of account (manual, mechanical or electronic format) recording receipts, payments, income or expenditure and vouchers, bank statements, invoices, fringe benefits provided, employer’s superannuation and retirement scheme contributions, payroll donations and accounts maintained pursuant to the imputation and policyholder credit regimes for a period of seven years after the end of the income year to which they relate. The records of a company that has been liquidated do not need to be retained. Commissioner’s discretion Records may be kept outside New Zealand, or in a foreign language, at the Commissioner’s discretion. A taxpayer wishing the Commissioner to exercise either of these discretions should make the appropriate application. The Commissioner is also authorised to  dispense with the record retention requirement. The policy in this area is not to consent to the destruction of books of account. There may, however, be some destruction of supporting records so long as that does not prevent a ready ascertainment of the taxpayer’s income and deductions. Inland Revenue (IR) will consider an application in respect of a close company, self-employed person, partnership or trust to destroy records after the expiry of four years from the end of the year in which an assessment was made. Factors to be taken into account include the record of compliance with IR (furnishing of returns, cooperation, etc), the reputation of the taxpayer in general business, the nature of the taxpayer’s business and the accounting system used. However, books of account (journals, ledgers, cashbooks) must still be kept for at least seven years after the end of the income year (or taxable period) to which they relate. Any application to destroy records should be made to IR. As taxpayers are increasingly making use of managing their tax obligations through their payroll or accounting software (some of which may be cloud-based computing technology), the legislation facilitates the storage of records offshore, if taxpayers so choose. See s 22(8) and (9). Inland Revenue-approved data storage providers can also apply on behalf of their clients. The Commissioner is empowered to revoke an authorisation. The following organisations have been approved to store taxpayers’ electronic records outside New Zealand: ▪ ActionStep New Zealand Ltd ▪ Adminis NZ Ltd ▪ Agilyx NZ Ltd ▪ Ascender HCM New Zealand Ltd ▪ Automatic Data Processing Ltd ▪ CargoWise NZ Ltd  ▪ Civica Pty Ltd ▪ CCH New Zealand Ltd ▪ Common Ledger Ltd ▪ Datacom Solutions Ltd ▪ Elmo Software Ltd ▪ Farm IQ Systems Ltd ▪ Fund a Future Ltd ▪ Fusion5 Limited ▪ Hnry Limited ▪ iPayroll Ltd ▪ Link Market Services Ltd ▪ MAGIQ Software Ltd ▪ MMC Group Holdings Ltd ▪ MYOB NZ Ltd ▪ Payroll Kiwi Ltd ▪ PeopleSonic Ltd ▪ Reckon New Zealand Pty Ltd ▪ Revolution Software Ltd ▪ Saasu Ltd ▪ Streamline Business NZ Ltd  ▪ TaxLab Ltd ▪ Tax Snaps Ltd ▪ Technology One New Zealand Ltd ▪ Thomson Reuters NZ Ltd (formerly Brookers Ltd) ▪ The Work Shop Limited T/A RIP Global ▪ Unimarket NZ Ltd, and ▪ Xero Ltd. Reduced retention period A qualifying individual (an individual who derives only reportable income and has no other income information that must be provided to the Commissioner) who is required to retain records only has to retain those records for 12 months after the end of the income year in which the income was derived. Before 1 April 2019, the seven-year record retention period was reduced to 12 months for a natural person to whom former s 33AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) applied or who was issued, or required to request, an income statement. Audit The Commissioner has the ability to extend the standard seven-year retention period to 10 years where a taxpayer’s affairs have been or are about to be audited or investigated by the Commissioner, or where the Commissioner intends to conduct such an investigation. Reduced retention period for classes of non-provisional taxpayers For records for payments from which tax has been deducted at source, the Commissioner may, by notice in the New Zealand Gazette, reduce the record retention period to 12 months from the  end of the income year or tax year to which the records relate for classes of taxpayers who are not provisional taxpayers. Electronic information Under s 22AAC of the TAA, where information contained in a taxpayer’s return has been transmitted electronically to IR, the taxpayer is required to retain the signed hard copy of this information for seven years after the end of the income year to which the return relates or a greater period than seven years where the taxpayer is under audit or is going to be audited under s 22(5) of the TAA. A taxpayer can, alternatively, retain an electronic form of information that has been transferred electronically as long as the electronic form provides a reliable means of assuring the integrity of the information is maintained and the information is readily accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference. Information does not need to be kept where the Commissioner has given notice that retention of a return is not required, the company concerned has been liquidated, or, before 1 April 2019, the return was an employer monthly schedule. Since 1 April 2019, taxpayers have not had to retain the employment income information (see ¶3023) provided to the Commissioner. For the purpose of the Inland Revenue Acts, a record may be retained in an electronic form only if: ▪ the record is readily able to be produced in paper form, and ▪ that paper form is a duplicate image of the original paper or other non-electronic form. However, if a record is received from a person in both paper (or other non-electronic form) and in electronic form, the record may be retained in its electronic form only. It does not matter that annotations, indexing references, or other additional information are included in the electronic record, provided they do not obscure any of the original information contained in the record and are distinguishable as additions to the original record.  A record that is generated in electronic form and provided to another person in paper or other non-electronic form may be retained in electronic form only. See sch 2, cl 4 of the Contract and Commercial Law (Electronic Transactions) Regulations 2017. The Commissioner has released a standard practice statement, SPS 13/01, “Retention of business records in electronic format, application to store records offshore and application to keep records in Māori” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25, No 3, April 2013 at 8), that applies from 11 March 2013. The SPS acknowledges that more taxpayers are choosing to use new technologies, such as cloud-based computing technologies in their businesses. Consequently, the SPS includes a requirement relating to adequate internal controls to ensure that business transactions are completely and accurately captured. Demonstration of security of information from both unauthorised access and data alteration is vital to the exercise of the Commissioner’s discretion to grant permission to store records offshore. An individual taxpayer who wants to store their business records offshore should apply to the Commissioner for authorisation before sending their records offshore. The SPS also covers emails, back-up of information and changes to hardware and software, and discusses the exercise of the Commissioner’s discretion to authorise offshore record keeping. The statement also discusses the information and assistance required from taxpayers when IR requests information. Appendix A to the statement covers applications to keep records in Māori (see further below). ▸ Note: In December 2020, IR released a draft standard practice statement, ED0226, “Retention of business records in electronic formats, application to store records offshore and keeping records in languages other than English or te reo Māori”. The draft statement is intended to replace SPS 13/01 when finalised and updates the Commissioner’s practice to take into account the requirements of the Contract and Commercial Law (Electronic Transactions) Regulations 2017.  Trustee records Trustees who forgive debts in consideration of natural love and affection (see ss EW 44 and EZ 39) must keep records of: ▪ amounts of debt forgiven by creditors, and ▪ amounts distributed to the trust’s beneficiaries. These records must be retained for as long as the trust exists. Trustees must also take all reasonable precautions for the safe custody of those records. Resident foreign trustee records Resident trustees of foreign trusts must keep and retain the following records: ▪ a record of assets and liabilities of the trust and details of all amounts received and expended by the trustee, and ▪ if the trust carries on a business, records of their accounting information system. See s 22(7)(d). If there is more than one resident foreign trustee, the resident foreign trustees may appoint one of themselves as agent for record-keeping purposes. The resident foreign trustee may apply for permission to keep records offshore, or in a language other than English or, from 26 June 2019, te reo Māori. Note that additional obligations apply for resident trustees of foreign trusts from 21 February 2017, see ¶25-488. Retention of records in Māori Before 26 June 2019, taxpayers had to apply to keep records in Māori. Appendix A to SPS 13/01 set out the factors the Commissioner would consider when a person applied to keep records (eg invoices, receipts, cash books and journals) for tax purposes in Māori. However, with effect from 26 June 2019, the provisions have been amended to allow taxpayers to hold tax records in te reo Māori  without first having to seek the Commissioner’s approval. The change is directed at internal documents held by taxpayers in compliance with the requirements and obligations of the TAA and GST Act. The change does not affect taxpayer obligations to use the English phrases in the GST Act, eg “tax invoice”, or to provide donations receipts in English. The change codifies IR operational practice since 1995. Financial reporting requirements One of the intended outcomes of the Financial Reporting Act 1993 was the removal of reporting obligations where they are seen as unnecessary, with consequent reduced compliance costs. As a result, small and medium-sized companies that are not issuers are not required to prepare general purpose financial reports. Instead, the decision to have such reports is made by shareholders. This change led to consequential changes being made to the financial statement requirements under the TAA. Minimum financial reporting requirements A company must prepare financial statements in accordance with prescribed minimum requirements unless the company is exempt: s 21B. Section 21C allows the following matters to be prescribed through Order in Council: ▪ minimum requirements for preparing financial statements ▪ the classes of taxpayers subject to those requirements ▪ classes of companies exempt from those requirements, and ▪ the period for which financial statements must be prepared. The Tax Administration (Financial Statements) Order 2014 (LI 2014/69), signed on 10 March 2014, sets minimum requirements for these simplified statements. Form of statements: the statements must contain a balance sheet and a profit and loss statement.  Applicable principles: the statements must be prepared using double-entry method for recording financial transactions and principles of accrual accounting. Valuations: valuation principles permitted may include: ▪ tax values, if consistent with double-entry and accrual accounting ▪ historical cost, if tax values are not consistent with double-entry and accrual accounting, or historical cost provides a better basis of valuation, and ▪ market values, if that method provides a better basis than tax values or historical cost. Accounting policies: the statements must contain a statement of accounting policies setting out the material policies that have been used or changed, and must indicate whether the financial statements are GST-inclusive or GST-exclusive. Taxation: interest and dividends received must be shown on an RWT-inclusive basis. Dividends must also be reported by including imputation credits if the dividend is taxable and the credit can be used to offset income tax. The schedule to the Tax Administration (Financial Statements) Order 2014 prescribes other matters that must be included in company financial statements. These include: ▪ a reconciliation of financial statements and the company’s taxable income, relevant amounts from forms prescribed by the Commissioner, such as an IR 10, and notes explaining exceptional items ▪ a taxation-based schedule of fixed assets and depreciable property ▪ information concerning cost of timber (for forestry companies) and specified livestock (for owners of such stock), and  ▪ from the tax year starting on 1 April 2015, various amounts relating to transactions between the company and any associated person who is either not a company, or is a nonresident company (for example, interest on a loan by the associate to the company). Exceptions The minimum financial reporting requirements do not apply to: ▪ Small companies: a small company is one that is not part of a group and that has both income and expenditure for the income year not exceeding $30,000. ▪ Non-active companies: a non-active company is one that is not required to file a return for an income year. These exemptions can also apply to a look-through company unless minimum financial reporting requirements are specified by some other enactment. If another enactment provides applicable minimum requirements for preparing financial statements for the company, the company must prepare its financial statements using those minimum requirements and is exempt from the ones prescribed in the Order. For example, if the company is a charity, it must prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the Charities Act 2005. If the company is a large company, it must prepare its financial statements in accordance with Pt 11 of the Companies Act 1993. Law: ELR reg 4; TAA ss 21B, 21C, 22, 22AAC, 22B  INLAND REVENUE ¶1-507 Introduction to Inland Revenue Inland Revenue (IR) is a department of State established under the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974. Since the repeal of that Act, s 5 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) provides for the  continuation of IR as originally established. Generally, IR’s function is to provide the administrative machinery to enable the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and IR officers to give effect to the Inland Revenue Acts. Ministers of the Crown and officers of Government agencies are explicitly bound by s 6 of the TAA to protect the integrity of the tax system. In Russell v Taxation Review Authority (2003) 21 NZTC 18,255 (CA), the taxpayer argued that the Commissioner failed to comply with his obligations in s 6 to act honestly and fairly in conducting proceedings before the Taxation Review Authority. This argument was rejected by the Court of Appeal. Further, the Court stated that the obligation upon the Commissioner to use his best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system did not render any conduct (not involving a decision) that might be inconsistent with that obligation amenable to judicial review. Also, s 6 should not be treated as giving an “expedient and inexpensive means to challenge the assessment”. An argument in relation to the Commissioner’s duty under s 6 was put forward by the taxpayer in Clarke v C of IR, Money v C of IR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,165. The High Court rejected the taxpayer’s proposition. The Minister of Revenue is responsible to Parliament for the operation of IR. The Minister, together with the Treasurer, also introduces into Parliament income tax amendments and other proposed legislation affecting IR. It is the Government, of which the Minister is a part, that determines the policies that affect the legislation under which IR operates, and it is Parliament that passes the legislation and gives it the force of law. The powers and functions exercised under the Income Tax Act 2007 and the other revenue Acts are exercised by the Commissioner, except for certain specific functions which are given to the Minister of Revenue. Law: TAA ss 5, 6  ¶1-509 Organisational structure of Inland Revenue  Inland Revenue (IR) is divided into a number of internal business groups: ▪ Business Transformation ▪ Corporate Integrity and Assurance ▪ Customer and Compliance Services — Business ▪ Customer and Compliance Services — Individuals ▪ Information and Intelligence Services ▪ Tax Counsel Office (before 17 February 2020, Office of the Chief Tax Counsel) ▪ People and Culture ▪ Performance, Facilities and Finance ▪ Policy and Strategy ▪ Technology, Strategy and Operations. Business Transformation Provides professional services to enable the delivery of the tax system (including the social policy measures that interact with the tax system) for the 21st century. This includes leading the Business Transformation programme, which is working with all parts of the department to completely transform the way IR interact with customers. Corporate Integrity and Assurance Provides independent advice, support and assurance on the integrity of the tax system, IR’s governance, and role in the wider state sector. Customer and Compliance Services — Business  Provides certainty and accuracy around complex and global tax compliance arrangements with Small-Medium Enterprise (SME), including non-profit organisations, and Significant Enterprise businesses. Connected with a range of business and delivery partners, representative bodies and government and international agencies to deliver joined-up services and reduce costs to customers and government. Also provides tax technical and legal support for Inland Revenue. Customer and Compliance Services — Individuals Makes tax compliance simpler by giving advice and support to individuals, families, and micro business customers, including nonprofit organisations. Helps ensure everyone pays and receives the right entitlements and gets it right from the start. Information and Intelligence Services Helps IR keep customers’ needs in mind as it transforms, and uses data insights and intelligence to help IR understand and influence customer behaviour. Tax Counsel Office (before 17 February 2020, Office of the Chief Tax Counsel) Provides technical advice and services on the interpretation and application of taxation law for IR and its customers. People and Culture Provides HR advice, tools and resources to build leadership, help shape organisational culture, and ensure IR has the right people with the right skills in the right jobs to lift organisation performance. Performance, Facilities and Finance Provides facilities for IR personnel, business performance analytics, financial and planning advice, and analysis. It also manages IR’s Crown accounting and reporting obligations. Policy and Strategy Provides tax and social policy advice to the Government, with the Treasury, and leads the development of IR strategy.  Technology, Strategy and Operations Develops, delivers, improves and supports IR’s ICT systems. A full listing of all IR phone numbers and addresses is available online at www.ird.govt.nz/contact-us.  ¶1-512 Commissioner of Inland Revenue The office of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is provided for under s 5B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). Under that section, the person appointed as chief executive of Inland Revenue (IR) under the Public Service Act 2020 (previously, the State Sector Act 1988) is designated the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Section 6A(1) expressly charges the Commissioner with the “care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts” and with any other functions conferred on him or her. The managerial discretion contained in this section allows the Commissioner to meet the duty to “collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law”, having regard to a number of factors listed in s 6A(2). It has been pointed out that the relationship between ss 6 (see ¶1507) and 6A needs to be considered to ensure consistency in the approaches to administering the tax system and collecting tax. These comments were made because there is an interpretation of these two sections which would permit the Commissioner to suspend the operation of the Inland Revenue Acts. See CCH, New Zealand Tax Planning Report, No 2, May 2000 at 13. The nature of the “care and management” powers of the Commissioner was considered in Fairbrother v C of IR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,548. In that case, IR had commenced proceedings to recover an undisputed tax debt. The taxpayer contended that the Commissioner had entered a binding agreement to accept less than the amount due and that, therefore, the Commissioner was estopped from taking the proceedings. The Commissioner sought to strike out the statement of defence on the grounds that there was no ability to settle.  The judge considered that the duty to exercise “care and management” allowed the power to settle. The duty in former s 6A(3) (now s 6A(2)) overrides everything that may be explicit or implicit in the Inland Revenue Acts (see 15,555 of the Fairbrother judgment). Therefore, anything that appears to be in conflict with the Commissioner’s duty in s 6A(2) has to give way. Agreeing to an instalment arrangement when seeking to recover a tax debt under s 156 of the TAA is considered to be an example of the managerial function contained in s 6A(1). See ¶2-165 and ¶2170. It appears that ss 6 and 6A specifically empower the Commissioner to enter into settlement arrangements, as made clear by the Court of Appeal in Auckland Gas Co Ltd v C of IR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,027 (CA). See ¶4-232. The Court of Appeal has also stated that ss 6 and 6A do not recognise a stand-alone duty of consistency owed by the Commissioner to a taxpayer when exercising her statutory powers in assessing their liability to tax by reference to her assessment of materially similar transactions undertaken by another taxpayer. There is nothing in ss 6 and 6A to displace correctness as the sole criterion for determining an appeal from an assessment. There is no scope for importing an absolute duty of consistency into that framework where it may undermine a discrete process for deciding a challenge to a determination of liability made according to law. See C of IR v Michael Hill Finance (NZ) Ltd (2016) 27 NZTC ¶22-056. On 20 October 2010, IR issued interpretation statement IS 10/07, “Care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 10, November 2010 at 17). This statement considers the relationship between the Commissioner’s duty to assess and collect taxes, and the various duties imposed under ss 6 and 6A of the TAA. Emphasis is given to the ambit and scope of former s 6A(2) (now s 6A(1)) which charges the Commissioner with the “care and management” of taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts. In addition to assessing and collecting income tax and related taxes, the Commissioner is responsible for the assessment and collection  of gaming duties (including the problem gambling levy) and GST. The Commissioner is also responsible for the administration of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. This Act sets out the obligations of holders and the Commissioner for unclaimed money held on behalf of the owner. IR administers the Act on behalf of the Treasury. The criteria for the payment of unclaimed money and IR’s role in administering the Act are set out in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 5, No 7, December 1993 at 1. ▸Note: In January 2020, Inland Revenue released a tax policy consultation document, “Unclaimed money”, which sets out proposals to more efficiently administer unclaimed money. Following consultation, proposed changes to substantially update the administration of the Unclaimed Money Act were included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill by way of Supplementary Order Paper No 510, introduced into Parliament on 10 June 2020. See further at ¶5225. The responsibility for administering the Working for Families Tax Credits scheme, the Child Support Act 1991, the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992, and the collection and payment of KiwiSaver contributions under the KiwiSaver Act 2006, is also a part of the Commissioner’s portfolio. At the end of each financial year, the Commissioner is required to furnish the Minister of Revenue with a report on the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. See s 13C of the TAA. The assessment and collection powers under the Income Tax Act 2007 are not vested in IR, they are vested in the Commissioner. All the officers of IR have only such of the Commissioner’s powers, functions and duties as are delegated to them by the Commissioner. It is under those delegated powers that the officers of IR operate. See Cates v C of IR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,237 (CA). Taxpayers are required to make the initial assessment of his or her own tax liability. However, the Commissioner still has the power to amend an assessment.  Law: TAA ss 5B, 6A, 7, 13C  ¶1-520 Commissioner’s duties When the Commissioner is discharging her statutory assessing function, she is performing a duty imposed upon her in imperative and unconditional terms. Any resulting assessment may be challenged under the disputes resolution procedures but not otherwise. Essentially, the nature of the Commissioner’s duties is to quantify the liability for tax which has already been imposed by the statute itself. The Commissioner is under a statutory duty to discharge her responsibilities, she cannot waive or suspend the application of the law unless she is vested with the statutory duty to do so and estoppel cannot be raised against her. Generally, the Commissioner is not subject to judicial restraint in discharging her statutory assessing function. See C of IR v Lemmington Holdings Ltd (1982) 5 NZTC 61,268. See ¶4-275. Theoretical basis This theoretical basis, which could possibly lead to great hardship when applied in practice, was explained by the Court of Appeal in North Island Wholesale Groceries Ltd v Hewin (1982) 5 NZTC 61,289. It is not difficult to conceive of a case in which a taxpayer may be adversely affected when the Commissioner retrospectively alters a ruling or changes policy. See, for example, Case S80 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,501 and Case S79 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,497. In C of IR v AGH Finance Ltd (1985) 7 NZTC 5,010, Cooke J stated at 5,012: If a taxpayer has put a proposal fully and fairly before the Commissioner or a District Commissioner and has received an assurance representing a view which could reasonably be taken as to factual or discretionary questions on a correct understanding of the law, I would be slow to adopt a different view, not because of any estoppel but simply because the considered view of the department at that time would be entitled to weight.  With effect from 26 June 2019, a more flexible approach to dealing with situations when the legislation does not align with the intended policy, ie a legislative anomaly, applies. The Commissioner’s care and management role has been extended by having more tools for addressing gaps or inconsistencies in the legislation that do not reflect the clear policy intent of a provision. More flexibility is provided as to how legislative anomalies are addressed by introducing delegated law-making powers that, in certain circumstances, can be used to temporarily remedy or mitigate the effect of obvious errors or inconsistencies. The remedial powers are: ▪ a power to modify how tax laws apply by Order in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue ▪ a power for the Commissioner to grant exemptions from provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts. Broadly, the powers can be used where there is an issue with tax legislation that produces an outcome that is inconsistent with intended policy outcomes (eg there is a drafting error or inconsistency in the legislation). While the best approach would be amendments to the primary tax legislation, this cannot always be achieved quickly and the new powers provide a temporary solution for taxpayers. The remedial powers are subject to a number of safeguards: ▪ modifications and exemptions have general application and cannot change the application of a tax law for a particular taxpayer ▪ six weeks of public consultation is generally required before a modification is made or an exemption is granted, unless a case of urgency exists ▪ modifications and exemptions are time-limited and expire within three years of coming into force  ▪ modifications and exemptions must be optional for taxpayers to apply and if they choose not to apply them, the law applies to the person as if the modification or exemption did not exist ▪ changes made must not be inconsistent with the intended purpose or object of the relevant provision ▪ modifications and exemptions are disallowable instruments and subject to review by the Regulations Review Committee and disallowance by the House of Representatives. Modifications made by Order in Council can apply retrospectively for a period of up to four income years before coming into force, ensuring taxpayers can apply a modification to all tax returns that are not subject to the time bar. Exemptions granted by the Commissioner (which are intended largely for administrative matters with negligible fiscal implications) can only apply retrospectively to the beginning of the income year in which the exemption is made. Law: TAA ss 5B, 6A-6F  ¶1-522 Commissioner’s temporary discretionary powers Commencing 17 March 2020, the Commissioner is armed with a temporary discretionary power to extend or otherwise modify due dates, deadlines, time periods or timeframes contained in the Inland Revenue Acts to ease compliance for taxpayers: ss 6H and 6I of the Tax Administration Act 1994. These administrative provisions were introduced as part of a second suite of tax measures to deal with the consequences of COVID-19. In particular, they deal with the practical difficulties faced by taxpayers in complying with their tax obligations because of the pandemic. The measure is temporary and will expire on 30 September 2021 unless extended by Order in Council. The purpose of the discretionary power is conveniently set out in s 6H(2): “The purpose of section 6I is to provide the Commissioner with some flexibility to mitigate the effect of a provision of the Inland  Revenue Acts when compliance is impossible, impractical, or unreasonable for a person or a class of persons in circumstances arising either from the imposition of COVID-19 response measures or as a consequence of COVID-19.” The Unclaimed Money Act 1971 is included in the definition of “Inland Revenue Acts” for these purposes. Variation The Commissioner may vary the application of a provision by: ▪ extending or otherwise modifying a due date, deadline, time period, or timeframe by, within, or in relation to which: □ a person must comply with a requirement set out in the provision □ a person must make an election under the provision, or □ a person’s entitlements, rights or obligations are affected ▪ modifying a procedural or administrative requirement a person must meet under the provision, for example, modifying the nature or form of information or action required under the provision. Note that when the provisions were first enacted, they referred only to extending a time-related requirement. However, a later retrospective amendment provided the Commissioner could also ‘otherwise modify’ a due date, deadline, time period or timeframe. This may include shortening or reducing it where this is advantageous to taxpayers. A variation applies generally unless it is expressly stated that it only applies to a particular class of taxpayers or circumstances, or that it requires certain conditions to be met to apply. The Commissioner must publish details of the variation, and she has indicated that all variations made under the new discretionary power will be published on the Inland Revenue website.  A taxpayer who complies with a variation made under s 6I is treated as having met their requirements under the relevant provision. However, a taxpayer may choose not to apply a variation by taking a tax position, such as in a tax return, or by informing the Commissioner. In that case, the law will apply to the taxpayer as if the variation did not apply. The discretionary power to make a variation under s 6I supplements the Commissioner’s other powers and is intended to be used only when the Commissioner considers an appropriate outcome is not possible or is difficult to achieve under the terms of an existing provision. Note that the Commissioner’s decision to make or not make a variation under s 6I is not a disputable decision. Law: TAA ss 3, 6H, 6I  ¶1-525 Binding rulings on taxation A system of binding rulings, Pt 5A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), has been in place since 1 April 1995. It allows the Commissioner to issue rulings on the future application of specific tax legislation. The types of rulings available are divided into four categories: public, product, private (including advance pricing agreements (APAs) and, from 1 October 2019, short-process rulings) and status rulings. Taxpayers are not bound by a ruling. The Commissioner, on the other hand, is bound by the rulings she issues. Binding rulings are not disputable decisions, and it is not possible to challenge rulings through the disputes resolution process. See s 138E of the TAA. Nor is there any separate right to appeal against a ruling. See also Inland Revenue (IR) guide to binding rulings (IR 715). Taxpayers who rely on official IR advice are not subject to use of money interest or to the unacceptable tax position penalty. See ¶14-  115 and ¶14-200. Public rulings Public rulings are initiated by the Commissioner and provide the Commissioner’s interpretation of particular tax legislation in a given fact situation. Taxpayers who calculate their tax liability in line with the ruling may expect to be assessed in accordance with the Commissioner’s stated interpretation of the relevant legislation. Notice of the making of a public ruling is posted in a publication of the Commissioner’s choice. Usually the text of the ruling is published in a Tax Information Bulletin. Public rulings apply for the duration of the period or income year specified in the ruling. The Commissioner can issue public binding rulings that apply for an indefinite period. Whether a public ruling is issued for a finite or an indefinite period is at the Commissioner’s discretion. If a ruling issued for an indefinite period is withdrawn, the ruling will continue to apply to an arrangement entered into before it was withdrawn for three years from the date of withdrawal. As with rulings issued for a finite period, a public ruling issued for an indefinite period will cease to apply following a legislative change if the repeal or amendment changes the way the taxation law applies in the ruling. See ss 91D– 91DE and 91G of the TAA. Private rulings In contrast to public rulings, private rulings are initiated by taxpayers who require confirmation as to how the legislation will apply in relation to a particular transaction. Strict disclosure requirements are imposed on taxpayers seeking such rulings. The private ruling binds the Commissioner only in respect of the particular person and arrangement identified in the application. Private rulings are charged for by IR on a full cost-recovery basis. The application fee charged is $322 (including GST), with an hourly rate of $161 (including GST) thereafter. Private rulings are not published. See the Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1999. The Commissioner can refuse to issue a ruling if a taxpayer has an outstanding debt relating to an earlier binding ruling application.  Also, a binding ruling cannot be made on a question of fact. In QB 07/05: “Ability to rule where the Commissioner is auditing or investigating — whether the Commissioner has a discretion to rule or is prohibited” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 10, November 2007), the Commissioner confirmed that she is prohibited from making a private ruling where a tax audit or investigation is occurring. Note that the Commissioner is allowed to make a private binding ruling if the arrangement is subject to a dispute by way of notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) but the application for the ruling relates to a different tax type from that in the NOPA. See s 91E(4)(ga) of the TAA. In QB 08/01, “Tax Administration Act 1994 — s 91E(4)(f) and selfassessment” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 5, June 2008 at 13), the Commissioner concludes that s 91E(4)(f) prevents her from issuing a private ruling where a taxpayer has already made a selfassessment by filing their tax return. In such cases the disputes resolution process would be available to the taxpayer (see ¶4-090 and ¶4-135). In QB 14/07, “Tax Administration Act 1994 — Proscribed questions” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 8, September 2014 at 19), the Commissioner concludes that including a statement relating to a proscribed question (such as a reference to a person’s intention) in the description of the Arrangement, or as an assumption or a condition, will not breach the provision that prevents the Commissioner from making a ruling that requires her to determine a proscribed question. QB 15/07, “Tax Administration Act 1994 — Meaning of ‘due and payable’ under section 91E(4)(d)(i)” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 8, September 2015 at 9), considers a specific situation where the Commissioner may not issue a private binding ruling for a taxpayer. This is when the matter on which the Commissioner has been asked to rule concerns a tax that is “due and payable”. The item concludes that this means that the Commissioner cannot issue a ruling unless the application is received before the due date for payment of the relevant tax type for the relevant tax period (regardless of whether  any tax is actually payable). For income tax generally, this is the due date for terminal tax payments for an income year (and does not include any provisional tax). For other types of tax (such as GST, PAYE, RWT and NRWT), this is the due date for payment of tax for the relevant period for which the Commissioner has been asked to rule. For the purpose of private and product rulings, an “arrangement” includes facts that the Commissioner considers are material or relevant as background or context to the ruling. See s 3(1) of the TAA, definition of “arrangement”. Despite being empowered to make a private ruling on application, the Commissioner may decide not to make a ruling to the extent to which it relates to how the Commissioner may adjust a taxpayer’s taxable income under s GA 1 if an arrangement is void under s BG 1. See s 91E(3B) of the TAA. Application for a private ruling is made by submitting a completed IR 713 to Technical Services, Tax Counsel Office (previously the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel). An applicant will need the following: ▪ the applicant’s details and IRD number ▪ an explanation of the issue(s) in question and a full description of the facts ▪ the taxation laws on which the ruling is sought ▪ the names of all other parties to the arrangement ▪ the relevant documents that relate to the question(s) raised, and ▪ a draft ruling. Factual review process Where a binding ruling is subject to a critical factual condition or assumption, a factual review may be appropriate. Relevant conditions or assumptions could relate to value, market rates or generally accepted accounting practices. Factual reviews can be  requested at any time before or immediately following the issue of the ruling. The factual condition or assumption must be both potentially contentious and central to the efficacy of the ruling. The process gives taxpayers an opportunity to obtain a level of certainty from IR regarding the likelihood that the condition or assumption will be satisfied. Once the review is completed, IR will send a written response with one of the following outcomes: ▪ a green letter confirms that IR considers the condition or outcome is likely to be satisfied — although the condition or assumption is not removed from the binding ruling ▪ an amber letter indicates that IR could not determine whether the condition or assumption would be satisfied within the time allocated to the review — IR will not necessarily audit the taxpayer simply because of an amber letter ▪ a red letter indicates that IR considers the condition or assumption will not be satisfied and puts the taxpayer on notice that an audit is likely. Although a green letter is not legally binding, provided the taxpayer does not deviate from the factual circumstances that exist when the green letter is issued, IR will not seek to further test the condition or assumption by way of audit other than in exceptional circumstances. Transfer pricing If the private ruling relates to a transfer pricing arrangement, then the applicant must confirm that they have examined the application and that the information disclosed to the Commissioner is comprehensive by completing an IR 713A declaration, as well as an IR 713. Advanced pricing agreements (APAs) are a type of private ruling that addresses transfer pricing compliance issues from a co-operative approach. They offer a practical solution to complex transfer pricing cases. The aim is to encourage upfront compliance and to resolve any potential disputes that may arise. Applicants for APAs must pay the application fee; however thereafter no further fees are charged. The International Audit unit can also issue unilateral APAs.  Short-process rulings With effect from 1 October 2019, the ability to obtain private binding rulings is extended to a wider range of taxpayers by simplifying the requirements for applying for a binding ruling and allowing IR to reduce the fees for smaller entities and/or transactions. A person with annual gross income below a prescribed level ($20m) and a tax question involving tax expected to be below a prescribed level ($1m) can apply for a short-process ruling. Note that if an application is made jointly, each person must meet the income threshold requirement. If the person is part of a group of companies, the group must meet that threshold. Where an application is made on behalf of a person not yet in legal existence (such as a company not yet incorporated), the person must have a reasonable expectation of meeting the income threshold requirement for the tax year to which the ruling relates. In the case of the tax threshold, if the expected amount of the tax is unknown, a person must state that in the application and the Commissioner may consider whether a shortprocess ruling is appropriate. The application for a short-process ruling has to be in a form prescribed by the Commissioner and only has to: ▪ identify the person applying for the ruling ▪ describe the circumstances on which the ruling is sought ▪ disclose all relevant facts and documents, and ▪ state the general tax outcome in relation to which the ruling is sought. Unlike a standard ruling application, the person does not have to state the taxation laws and the propositions of law for which the ruling is sought. The Commissioner may decline to make a short-process ruling if the question asked, because of its nature or in the particular  circumstances, makes it inappropriate for a response under the shortened process. For example, when an application: ▪ raises an issue involving an apparent gap or deficiency in policy settings ▪ is directly in opposition to an existing policy of, or technical position taken by, the Commissioner ▪ raises an issue that has, or would have, significant implications or wide effect as a precedent ▪ fails to provide sufficient information ▪ raises a question that is better answered by the Commissioner through another process. The Commissioner may also decline to issue a short-process ruling for the same reasons as she may decline to issue a standard private binding ruling. The application and hourly rate fees for short-process rulings will be lower than the current fees for private binding rulings. The Commissioner has a discretion to set the rates. Officials have stated they should be significantly lower and interested parties will be consulted. The Commissioner can withdraw a short-process ruling where there is a change in the interpretation of the law or where the ruling needs to be replaced with a variation. The withdrawal will take effect from the date of withdrawal. The date cannot be earlier than the date on which the person could reasonably be expected to receive the notice of withdrawal. The ruling will no longer apply if the arrangement had not been entered into until after the date of withdrawal. However, the ruling will continue to apply for the period specified in the ruling if the arrangement was entered into before the date of withdrawal. Where a short-process ruling is issued for an issue that does not involve an arrangement, if that ruling is subsequently withdrawn, taxpayers can  continue to rely on the ruling for the remainder of the period or tax year specified in the ruling. Changes to extend the scope of rulings With effect from 18 March 2019, the scope of matters that can be ruled on has been extended. In summary, the key changes are: ▪ allowing rulings to be made on a taxpayer’s purpose in certain circumstances, such as whether the taxpayer has the purpose of selling a property when they acquire it ▪ allowing questions that affect or define the status of a person, such as whether a person is a New Zealand resident or an associated person, to be ruled on ▪ allowing rulings on the status of a person, item or matter to be made without requiring an “arrangement” ▪ allowing the Commissioner to rule on a financial arrangement question for which she could previously only issue a determination, and ▪ clarifying the difference between an assumption and a condition and when a ruling ceases to apply because a condition or assumption is breached. Product rulings Product rulings are made in response to taxpayer applications, as with private rulings, but their making is discretionary rather than mandatory. They are directed at particular transactions, rather than at the particular taxpayers who may enter those transactions, although, in cases in which a product ruling might have application to a wider class of products or persons, the Commissioner may indicate this by reference to “consumers” of the product. Product rulings are published in the Tax Information Bulletin. The application and processing fees are the same as for private rulings (see above).  Application for a product ruling is made by submitting a completed IR 714 to Technical Services, Tax Counsel Office (previously the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel). An applicant will need the following: ▪ the applicant’s details and IRD number ▪ an explanation of the issue(s) in question and a full description of the facts ▪ an explanation as to why it is not practicable to seek a private ruling ▪ the taxation laws on which the ruling is sought ▪ an explanation as to why the characteristics of the taxpayers who have entered into the arrangement will not be relevant to the ruling ▪ the relevant documents that relate to the question(s) raised, and ▪ a draft ruling. Period for which a private or product ruling applies Over the years, the Commissioner has developed internal guidelines concerning the period of issue of a private or product ruling. In April 2017, the Commissioner released a QWBA, QB 17/03, “Tax Administration Act 1994 — The period for which a private or product ruling applies” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 5, June 2017 at 196), discussing the relevant factors the Commissioner will consider when exercising her discretion and outlining her practice as follows: ▪ Where an arrangement has a term or expected life of less than three years, the Commissioner will issue a ruling for a period that is the exact term or expected life of the arrangement. ▪ Where an arrangement has a term or expected life of more than three years, the Commissioner will generally rule for a period of three years from the date of issue of the draft or final ruling.  ▪ On a reissue of a ruling, where an arrangement has a remaining term or expected life of more than five years, the Commissioner will generally rule for a period of five years from the date the previous ruling ceased to apply. ▪ Periods in excess of five years (for a new ruling or a reissue) will only be considered by the Commissioner in exceptional circumstances where, due to the special characteristics of the particular arrangement and the application of the taxation laws, a shorter period would not be sensible. Where a private or product ruling is issued for an issue that does not involve an arrangement, if that ruling is subsequently withdrawn, taxpayers can continue to rely on the ruling for the remainder of the period or tax year specified in the ruling. Commissioner’s statement on information sharing In May 2016, the Commissioner released Commissioner’s statement CS 16/01, “OECD information sharing requirements for taxpayer rulings and determinations”. As part of the OECD Action Plan to address Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) activities, OECD and G20 countries, including New Zealand, are required to exchange information spontaneously about taxpayer-specific rulings issued on cross border activities. The Commissioner’s statement sets out the six categories of rulings relating to cross border activities identified by the OECD that she will be obliged to share information on. The Commissioner’s information exchange obligations cover all private and product rulings, advance pricing agreements and financial arrangements determinations that fall within the OECD’s criteria. Where relevant, the Commissioner is required to ensure that information is exchanged within three months of the ruling being issued. The information exchange obligations apply to: ▪ past rulings (issued on or after 1 January 2010 that were still in effect on or after 1 January 2014), and ▪ future rulings (those issued on or after 1 April 2016).  For further information, see the Commissioner’s statement published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 5, June 2016 at 14. Issue of replacement ruling with retrospective application If a private or product ruling contains an immaterial error that does not affect the technical conclusion of the ruling, it is the Commissioner’s view that the ruling may be withdrawn and replaced by another ruling that operates retrospectively for all or some of the same period as the ruling that has been withdrawn. See “Questions we’ve been asked” QB 08/02: “Commissioner’s power to issue a replacement ruling that operates retrospectively” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 7, August 2008 at 17). Withdrawal of rulings The Commissioner can withdraw a private ruling at any time by notifying the applicant in writing. See s 91EI. The private ruling is withdrawn from the date specified in the notice of withdrawal. That date may not be earlier than the date on which the person could reasonably be expected to receive the notice of withdrawal. The Commissioner can withdraw a public or product ruling at any time by giving notice in a chosen publication, eg a Tax Information Bulletin. See ss 91DE and 91FJ. Legislation covered by rulings As well as income tax provisions, binding rulings may be made on provisions of the GST Act (except ss 12 and 13), the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968, the Gaming Duties Act 1971, and the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. The Commissioner may also make a binding ruling on how the Commissioner will exercise a discretion under any of those provisions. With effect from 18 March 2019, it has also been clarified that the Commissioner may make a binding ruling for any record-keeping requirement in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Effect of legislative change on binding rulings — status rulings A ruling will continue to apply after a legislative change if the repeal or amendment does not change the way in which the taxation law  applies. Taxpayers who are unclear as to whether a change in law has affected the status of a private or product ruling they have obtained can apply to the Commissioner for a “status ruling” to clarify this. (Application is made by submitting an IR 712.) The Commissioner has to make a status ruling if the legislative change in question is legislation that is stated to apply in the taxpayer’s private or product ruling. The Commissioner can refuse to make a status ruling if the legislation is not referred to in the ruling. See ss 91GA– 91GH of the TAA. Binding rulings issued before the 2008–09 income year continue to apply following the enactment of the Income Tax Act 2007. See s ZA 4. “Materially different” arrangement In March 2018, Inland Revenue released a Question We’ve Been Asked, QB 18/07, “When is an arrangement considered to be ‘materially different’ from the arrangement identified in a private or product ruling?” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 30, No 4, May 2018 at 18). The item concludes that the revised arrangement is “materially different” if, in relation to a tax type, the difference between the revised arrangement and the arrangement identified in the ruling is capable of affecting the tax outcome referred to in the ruling. Whether the revised arrangement is materially different from the arrangement identified in the ruling will be considered on a case-bycase basis, because it will turn on the facts and circumstances of each case. The QWBA contains a number of examples. Note that with the expansion of the scope of matters that can be ruled upon without the need for an arrangement, the circumstances in which a private ruling does not apply have also been expanded to include where “the circumstances are materially different from the circumstances described in the ruling” (ie not limited to situations where an arrangement exists). Non-binding statements As well as issuing binding rulings, the Commissioner disseminates information through the Tax Information Bulletin. This publication  usually contains non-binding statements covering the Commissioner’s administrative practice and view of the law. The Commissioner may issue four types of non-binding statements, namely: ▪ interpretation statements, setting out the Commissioner’s view of the law in relation to a particular set of circumstances ▪ interpretation guidelines, in which the Commissioner’s approach to the interpretation of a general area of law is discussed ▪ questions we’ve been asked, which set out answers to enquiries received that may be of general interest to taxpayers, and ▪ standard practice statements, which describe how the Commissioner will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with a practical issue arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. Although these statements are not legally binding on the Commissioner, the practical effect of a statement being issued is that IR staff have an obligation to follow any directions contained in the statement. See Miller v C of IR, McDougall v C of IR (No 1) (1997) 18 NZTC 13,001 at 13,048. However, failure to follow the statement will not invalidate the exercise of a statutory duty. See O’Neil v C of IR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,051 (PC) and Dandelion Investments Ltd v C of IR (2003) 21 NZTC 18,010 (CA). The implications of the Dandelion Investments case are discussed in an article by Andrew Beck in CCH, New Zealand Tax Planning Report, No 2, April 2003. Interpretation statements and guidelines and questions we’ve been asked are generally issued by the Public Rulings unit of the Tax Counsel Office (before 17 February 2020, the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel) and the standard practice statements are usually issued by IR’s Legal and Technical Services group. The Commissioner issued a statement, “Status of the Commissioner’s advice” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 10,  December 2012 at 86) setting out the status of advice (other than binding rulings). The statement considers: ▪ the legal status of the Commissioner’s advice and when the Commissioner will be bound by statements made ▪ taxpayers’ liability for substantive tax, penalties and use of money interest where the Commissioner’s advice is incorrect ▪ the application dates for public statements ▪ the Commissioner’s position in relation to court and tribunal decisions that the Commissioner believes do not accurately reflect the law, and ▪ the status of standard practice statements issued by the Commissioner. Generally, the Commissioner will follow public statements; however, she is not strictly bound by such statements. The Commissioner’s approach to advice that is not binding is set out in the statement. Where a new position is taken and it is more favourable for a taxpayer, the Commissioner will apply the principles relating to amending assessments under s 113 of the TAA, on a case-by-case basis. Where the new position taken is less favourable to a taxpayer, the Commissioner will generally apply the new position prospectively from a date, income year or assessment period stated by the Commissioner. Corrections to Tax Information Bulletins are made from time to time by IR and can be found listed on IR’s website at www.ird.govt.nz. In January 2017, the Commissioner released a document that sets out IR’s internal approach to managing changes or perceived changes to IR’s tax/social policy technical interpretation, or practice of administering tax legislation. It is intended to provide guidance to staff in deciding what action to take in such circumstances and deals with a wider set of circumstances than those addressed by the  Commissioner’s above statement on the status of advice, in particular where there has not been a previous public position taken. Revenue Alerts From time to time the Commissioner may issue a Revenue Alert. This provides information about significant and/or emerging tax planning issues that are of concern to IR. At the time an alert is issued, risk assessments will already be underway to determine the level of risk and to consider appropriate responses. A Revenue Alert will identify: ▪ the issue (which may be a scheme, arrangement or particular transaction) which the Commissioner believes may be contrary to the law, or is inconsistent with policy ▪ the common features of the issue, and ▪ IR’s current view and current approach. IR technical rulings The Technical Rulings Manuals are manuals that were written many years ago for the benefit of IR staff who worked in technical areas. Official versions of the manual were released upon request under the Official Information Act 1982. Although the manuals were written for IR staff and were not subjected to the degree of analysis and consultation before issue that occurs with current IR publications, they were nevertheless a useful indication of the Commissioner’s views or practice on the issues covered in the rulings. However, over time, as other publications and sources of information became available, IR staff became less reliant on the technical rulings. As a result, the technical rulings were not updated on a regular or consistent basis and, in 1998, IR decided to formally cease updating the technical rulings altogether. In a statement made at that time, IR advised that although the technical rulings may be useful as background material, they should not be relied upon as representing the Commissioner’s current views or practice. Public Information Bulletins  IR published Public Information Bulletins (PIBs) regularly between September 1963 and July 1989. They comprised a range of statements on taxation issues, as well as legislative commentary, public notices and other information. Tax Information Bulletins replaced PIBs from July 1989. In February 2011, IR announced that a review of PIBs had commenced — “Review of Public Information Bulletins” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 1, February 2011 at 116). The review was carried out due to concern that items published in PIB items contained limited analysis or reasoning to support the views expressed and the items were often out of date. Many items referred to legislation that had been repealed or amended, or the Commissioner’s views or reasoning had developed or changed significantly since the time of publication. IR completed the formal process of reviewing all items containing tax technical information in the 183 PIB volumes and identifying those that were of no current relevance and would not be republished. The remainder have either been updated and republished in a current Tax Information Bulletin or, in the case of a small number, are to be given further consideration. The results of the review are published on the IR website at www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/pib-review. The website contains tables of completed PIB reviews, and links to archived historical legislative commentary contained in the PIBs. The items still noted as being under consideration should continue to be referenced with some care and should not necessarily be taken as the Commissioner’s current view of the law or operational practice. Also note that the review initially aimed to consider early TIB items (ie ones issued before 1996) as well. Due to issues of resourcing and competing priorities, this was not achieved. Care should also be taken when referencing these items given their age. Status of historical IR internal circulars In March 2014, IR released a public item (PUB0199) on the status of historical IR internal circulars. During the review of the PIBs, discussed above, IR became aware that some advisers and commentators were still citing historical IR internal circulars as  evidence of IR’s practice or view of the law. The public item makes it clear that the circulars have not been updated or reviewed since publication and that they cannot be relied on as representing current IR practice or interpretation of the law. The item states that the circulars include, but are not limited to: ▪ Information Circulars (1952–1973) ▪ Operation(s) Circulars (1984–1996) ▪ Technical Policy Circulars (1983–1989) ▪ GST Circulars (1986–1987) ▪ Targeted Circulars (1990–1997) ▪ Technical Bulletins (1955–1967) ▪ FBT Circulars (1985) ▪ Technical Rulings Supplements (approximately 1977– approximately 1983). Law: IT07 s ZA 4; TAA Pt 5A, ss 3(1), 138E(1)(ea)  ¶1-530 Small business cashflow scheme The Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme (SBCS) has been established by the Government to provide loans to assist small-tomedium businesses, including sole traders and the self-employed, in the circumstances arising from the continuing impact of the COVID19 pandemic. The scheme allows the Commissioner, on behalf of the Crown, to grant a one-off loan with a term of five years to qualifying businesses. Applications can be made from 12 May 2020 to 31 December 2023 inclusive. (Note that the application date was extended from 12 June to 24 July on 5 June 2020, then from 24 July to 31 December 2020  on 5 July 2020, and finally from 31 December 2020 to 31 December 2023 on 9 November 2020.) Eligibility criteria Only businesses that were eligible to claim a COVID-19 wage subsidy (see ¶5-765) of $351,480 or less may apply for funding under the SBCS. This equates to 50 full-time employees, meaning the scheme is largely restricted to small- and medium-sized businesses. ▸ Note: In December 2020, the government announced a number of changes to the SBCS. One of these changes was to the employee number test. From early February 2021, businesses applying will be measured on the number of employees they have at the point they apply. Currently, employee numbers are measured at the point the business received the wage subsidy or 9 June 2020. In addition, the business must be viable to qualify, and there must be a plan to ensure it remains viable. Inland Revenue considers this to mean that the directors or owners have good reason to believe it is more likely than not the business will be able to pay its debts as they fall due within the next 18 months. Evidence of the ongoing viability of the business at the time of requesting the loan must be kept. This could include, for example: ▪ A cashflow forecast for the short term. ▪ A plan for where revenue will come from in future market conditions, and a forecast of those revenues. ▪ Financial statements showing the business has enough resources to sustain itself when including the SBCS loan. ▪ An accountant’s assessment that the business is viable and ongoing. If a business receives funds under the scheme but does not meet the eligibility criteria, the person must immediately repay the total amount of the SBCS loan to the Commissioner.  Loan amount The amount that can be loaned is $10,000 plus $1,800 for every fulltime-equivalent employee, up to a maximum of $100,000, or $11,800 for a sole trader. To determine the number of full-time-equivalent employees, the wage subsidy amount received by the business, or which would have been received if the business had applied for the subsidy, is divided by the amount received for one full-time employee, ie $7,029.60. The result is rounded up to give the number of full-time-equivalent employees. Example: Scott’s Signage Scott’s Signage has 8 full-time and 4 part-time employees and would have received $73,036.80 in wage subsidies. For the purposes of the maximum loan size, Scott’s Signage is considered to have 11 full-time-equivalent employees. $73,036.80 divided by $7,029.60 is 10.4 – rounded up to 11.  A business may apply for the full loan amount available or a smaller loan. However, a business may only make one loan application and no amendments can be made after the loan has been applied for. ▸ Note: Another change announced by the government was that, from early February 2021, business that have fully repaid their loan before the end of 2023 will be able to re-borrow one further time, providing they meet the other eligibility criteria. However, if a business has defaulted on a previous loan, they will not be eligible to re-borrow. No interest will be charged if the loan is paid back in full within two years of the loan being made available to the business; otherwise, interest at 3% pa will apply from the original date that the loan was made available. The maximum term of the loan is five years. Note that when first introduced the interest-free period was one year. However, this was extended to two years on 9 November 2020. Applying for the loan  Businesses will only be able to apply for the SBCS loan through myIR. Applications will be open from 12 May 2020 to 31 December 2023 inclusive. As well as satisfying the eligibility requirements set out above, businesses applying for the loan must have a New Zealand Business Number and will also need to confirm the following: ▪ the business is experiencing a minimum 30% decline in actual or predicted revenue as defined in the wage subsidy scheme in any 30-day period from Jan 2020 to June 2020, compared with the same period in the previous year ▸ Note: The government also announced that, from early February 2021, the criteria relating to the decline in revenue will change. A business will have to show: □ at least a 30% decline in actual revenue □ measured over any 14-day period in the previous six months and — compared with the same 14-day period of a year ago, or — if the revenue from the same period a year ago was affected by COVID-19, compared with the same 14day period two years ago, or — if the applicant was not in business a year ago, compared with the same or similar period in the previous month, and □ the revenue drop arose from the continuing impact of COVID-19. ▪ the business existed before 1 April 2020 ▸ Note: The final change announced by the government was that, from early February 2021, businesses that were established after 1 April 2020 will be able to apply for the  scheme, provided they have been in business for at least six months before applying and they meet the other eligibility criteria. ▪ the loan will not be passed through to the shareholders or owners of the business, for example, by a dividend or a loan to the shareholders or owners ▪ the applicant has authority to commit the business to the loan – tax agents, bookkeepers, nominated persons and other representatives cannot apply for the loan on behalf of the person they are representing ▪ the applicant is 18 years or over and has the legal right to apply for the loan, and ▪ the applicant is aware Inland Revenue is not providing financial or other advice regarding this loan. Note that, when originally introduced, the loan could only be used to pay for core operating costs (including, but not limited to, rent, insurance, utilities, supplier payments, or rates). However, this was broadened from 9 November 2020 so that the loan can be used, for example, on capital expenditure. Loan contract Successful applicants under the scheme will be bound by the terms of a loan contract. The contract sets out the terms of the loan, including the timing and manner of loan repayments to be made. A copy of the loan contract can be found on the Inland Revenue website. A loan contract under the SBCS is not a credit contract or a consumer credit contract for the purposes of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003. Repayment of loan  A business will have 5 years (60 months) to pay off the loan. During the loan period, the following general rules apply: ▪ If the loan is repaid in full within two years, no interest will be charged. ▪ If the loan is not repaid in full within two years, interest is charged for the entire term of the loan. ▪ Repayments are not compulsory in the first 24 months. ▪ Voluntary payments can still be made over the first 24 months. ▪ After 24 months, regular payments must be made for both the principal and interest. Tax implications Income will not arise under the financial arrangement rules if a business is released from the obligation to make payments under the terms of the SBCS loan: see s EW 45(1)(b)(iv) and ¶6-430. Section DF 1 (see ¶10-513) will not apply to deny a deduction for expenditure funded by a SBCS loan. Note that the Commissioner’s decision to grant, or decline to grant, a SBCS loan under s 7AA is not a disputable decision. Information sharing The Ministry of Social Development may provide information related to the wage subsidy scheme to the Commissioner for the purposes of the administration of the SBCS. Law: IT07 ss DF 1, EW 45; TAA ss 3, 7AA  ¶1-560 Inland Revenue investigations The current structure of Inland Revenue’s (IR) audit activity is aligned to specific taxpayer groups. By focusing on taxpayer groups, IR aims to target its investigation activity towards areas with the  potential for high-risk non-compliance, while maintaining an audit presence in all sectors of the community. Potential candidates for audit are identified using a computerised case selection and management system called eCase. This system is an electronic tool that helps IR staff manage audits. Investigation activity may include spot checks and small, single revenue/period audits through to large in-depth investigations that cover several years and revenues. Since 1 July 2004 the IR’s investigators have carried out full risk evaluations of taxpayers before deciding whether or not to investigate them. The risk evaluation identifies the compliance risks for all revenues, outstanding debts and returns. See IR newsletter, AGENTSanswers, Issue 60, August 2004.  ¶1-570 Enforcement procedures of Inland Revenue The Commissioner has formulated several procedures that are followed when investigating the income tax affairs of persons and companies suspected of being delinquent in their responsibilities to tax matters. The powers that the Commissioner has to perform her administrative duties are exercised by Inland Revenue (IR) officers. Telephone inquiries Telephone inquiries are connected with the processing of the taxpayer’s annual return and are mostly of a routine nature. It should be noted that any rulings given over the phone have no legal force when the Commissioner makes or amends an assessment. This is because the Commissioner may not be estopped by the previous actions of IR officers when he makes an assessment. See ¶1-520. See also Case S80 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,501 and Case S79 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,497. Audits and investigations Audits of tax records are an important element of IR’s strategy to encourage voluntary compliance. Auditing is a specialised aspect of IR’s administration of the tax system. The taxpayer audit (also  referred to as investigations) programme’s purpose is to detect noncompliance and deter future non-compliance. This is achieved by: having a presence in all sectors; targeting risk areas; using a combination of audit and other methods, such as education; giving non-compliers the information they need to be able to comply; penalising non-compliance; assisting in the collection of assessed tax; and identifying opportunities for legislative, policy and administrative improvements. Single revenue audits are an important part of the activities for the business and non-business units of the taxpayer audit programme. Other types of audits include extended GST audits, presence audits, full investigations, and avoidance and evasion investigations. Spot checks and projects are conducted to match information to third party records to locate businesses outside the tax system or to detect those not declaring all income. Project-based scoping audits are carried out to gather information about the risk of non-compliance of a particular industry or occupation, or over a specific tax issue. A small random sample is investigated to assess the status of compliance. Scoping audits may lead to full audits or the development of strategies to address the compliance issues identified. Project-based audits are carried out by service centre or branch office staff although they may be coordinated centrally. Non-business audits generally focus on omitted interest and salary and wages income. Tax amnesties On rare occasions, the Commissioner announces a tax amnesty for a limited period to bring taxpayers who have not disclosed their income into the tax net. An amnesty is usually accompanied by reduced penalties for the tax evaders and avoiders. An example of such an amnesty was the amnesty until 31 March 2013 for taxpayers who made a voluntary disclosure in respect of “Penny and Hooper” type cases, as set out in Revenue Alert RA 11/02.  A provision relating to tax amnesties was added in 2007. The rules relating to amnesties can be summarised as follows: ▪ IR may declare a limited amnesty in relation to a specific industry or activity where tax evasion is a significant concern. The offer will specify the taxes involved and the period in which the taxpayer can come forward. ▪ Taxpayers who come forward during the amnesty will only be required to declare undisclosed income for two years (ie the current year and the preceding year). ▪ The amnesty will be backed up by increased audit activity in that particular industry. ▪ An affected taxpayer coming forward under an amnesty will not be prosecuted. However, penalties and interest will still apply to the income tax assessed for the disclosure period, but may be reduced for voluntary disclosure and good behaviour. ▪ Repayments of family assistance and back payments of child support and student loans for the disclosure period will still apply. ▪ The amnesty only applies to income from the specific targeted industry. The two-year limit does not apply to income from other sources. ▪ At the end of any amnesty, IR will be required to notify responsible Ministers by providing a report, and the Minister must provide the report to Parliament. Law: TAA s 226B  ¶1-572 Methods for calculating tax in cases of evasion When a case of evasion is detected, there are a number of methods that can be employed to calculate the amount of tax that should have  been paid: ▪ the assets accretion method (see ¶1-574) ▪ the add-back method: adding back into the taxpayer’s assessable income items of income that Inland Revenue discovers the taxpayer should have returned (see ¶1-582) ▪ the comparative method: comparing the returns of taxpayers whose affairs are very similar (see ¶1-584), and ▪ the cash available method (see ¶1-586).  ¶1-574 Assets accretion — generally In preparing an assets accretion statement, the officer broadly ascertains the assets possessed by the taxpayer at the beginning of the period under review, ascertains the increase in assets (assets less liabilities) in each of the subsequent years concerned and adds the taxpayer’s estimated living expenses and other items of nondeductible expenditure. The total is regarded as being equal to the taxpayer’s income plus any non-taxable income received in the same period. In the absence of a convincing explanation by the taxpayer as to the source of those assets, it is assumed that the taxpayer’s improved capital position has been brought about by undisclosed income and he or she will be assessed accordingly. Example: A taxpayer was an unemployed motor cycle club president. The Commissioner issued default assessments against the taxpayer for income tax and GST for the years 1989 to 1993 inclusive. The assessments were issued as a result of an assets accretion review compiled from 1 October 1988 to 31 March 1993. The statement showed an increase in assets from $24,580.55 to $252,274.99. The Commissioner was of the view that the taxpayer’s lifestyle was such that he must have been earning undisclosed profits from cannabis dealing and/or motor vehicle trading. Judge Barber agreed that the assets accretion method showed that the taxpayer was steadily deriving funds from some undisclosed source or activity, although some of the items were found to be overstated. The statement and consequential assessments were amended in favour of the taxpayer. See Case S101 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,637.  The assets accretion method was also applied by IR to tax the proceeds of crime in Case W27 (2003) 21 NZTC 11,276. The taxpayer may challenge the assessment under the usual disputes procedure but the burden of proof remains with the taxpayer. The taxpayer’s challenge may be based on undisclosed gambling proceeds (ie a taxpayer will offer the argument that a discrepancy between assets and reported income is attributable to gambling proceeds), cash hoards, sale of private assets or money lent/given to the taxpayer by family members.  ¶1-580 Assets accretion — calculation of living expenses A court will confirm an assets accretion statement only when the facts used in the preparation of the statement are accurate. See Hall v C of IR [1965] NZLR 184. Any living expenses included in an assets accretion statement should reflect the living expenses of that taxpayer and not the average taxpayer. Rather than trying to ascertain the amount spent on living expenses by the taxpayer for all the years covered by the assets accretion statement, an officer will calculate the living expenses for one year only. The officer will then use that information as a base to calculate the probable living expenses for the other years by using the consumer price index (CPI) movements between the base year and the other years in the statement. The key to living expenses included in the assets accretion statement is the accuracy of the living expenses used for the base year. Although it is a common technique of the Commissioner’s to use the CPI in order to assess income for subsequent years, having established income for the base year, it is still open for a taxpayer to discharge the onus of proof on the balance of probabilities by giving evidence that assumptions in the Inland Revenue’s techniques are incorrect. Important points Some points that have emerged from the discussions of the assets accretion concept are:  ▪ It is not enough to discharge the onus of proof if the taxpayer’s evidence at best only raises doubts as to the accuracy of the assessment. See Yew v C of IR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,710, Case R4 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,025. ▪ A taxpayer who relies on personal evidence alone, without the support of corroborating credible records, may find it difficult to discharge the onus of proof. See Case J23 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,129, Case J36 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,206. ▪ Living expenses may be ascertained by use of the CPI. See Dunnenberger v C of IR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,299. However, this is inappropriate if a cheaper alternative lifestyle is followed. See Case F93 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,024, Case G84 (1985) 7 NZTC 1,388, Case H28 (1986) 8 NZTC 270, Case H78 (1986) 8 NZTC 534, Case J64 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,379. ▪ The Commissioner’s estimate of living expenses is not upheld if it is based on guesswork; ie the assumption that all unexplained bank withdrawals must relate to living expenses. See Case G48 (1985) 7 NZTC 1,200. ▪ In apportionment cases, the onus of proof (on the balance of probabilities) is on the taxpayer to establish how much of an outgoing in question constitutes a deduction from assessable income. See Buckley & Young Ltd v C of IR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271.  ¶1-582 Add-back method This method will most probably be used when the business accounts are maintained on a commercially sound basis but, because of an understatement of identifiable receipts or a claim of expenses that is not fully deductible, the profits are not correct for taxation purposes.  ¶1-584 Comparative method  For certain taxpayers, eg milk vendors, taxi drivers, etc, an investigator may try to arrive at the income of a business by using a specific formula. This method may be used when an investigator is confident that the business accounts show the true expenditure of that business but the investigator suspects that all of the business receipts have not been recorded. In most cases, this method is used when there have been statutory regulations governing either the sale of the product in question or the scale of fees that the taxpayer can charge.  ¶1-586 Cash available method The cash available method isolates the cash available to the taxpayer for a year and compares that amount with any nonbusiness cash payments made. The cash available method is used when it is suspected that a taxpayer who owns a cash business, eg a video shop, is dipping into the till and removing cash takings without keeping a record of amounts taken.  ¶1-590 Inland Revenue’s powers to collect information The powers of the Commissioner and, by delegation, of other officers of Inland Revenue (IR) are quite extensive and, in some respects, are more comprehensive than police powers. Most of those powers relate to the collection of information to enable the making of assessments of income tax and the other taxes and duties which IR is responsible for collecting. Many of them are implicit in provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007. However, the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) gives specific additional powers. The obligation to provide information to the Commissioner is imposed on all persons, not just a taxpayer under investigation. For example, in Next Generation Investments Ltd (in liq) v C of IR (2006) 22 NZTC 19,775, the High Court held that liquidators, when faced with a request for information under s 17 of the TAA, are obliged to permit the Commissioner to inspect the books and accounts of a company without a court order (as required under s 256 of the Companies Act 1993) even where the Commissioner is a creditor of the company.  The Commissioner’s powers concerning the production of taxpayerrelated information were rewritten in 2019 as part of the Inland Revenue Business Transformation programme. The provisions are contained in Pt 3 subpart 3A of the TAA and these were rewritten with effect from 18 March 2019. The rewritten provisions have also been restructured to make them easier to navigate and to apply. Broadly, the statutory framework now comprises: ▪ purposes and principles of the subpart: ss 16–16C ▪ collection and use of information by Commissioner: ss 17–17M ▪ confidentiality of sensitive revenue information: ss 18 and 18B (see ¶1-604) ▪ permitted disclosures of sensitive revenue information: ss 18C– 18J (see ¶1-606–¶1-640). The rewriting of the provisions did not involve any policy change, apart from the introduction of a new regulation-making power for the repeat collection of specified data. In addition, it has been clarified explicitly in the legislation that information collected for one revenue purpose can be used for another revenue purpose. Section 227F of the TAA specifically provides that ss 16–17K are former ss 16–19, 21 and 21BA in rewritten form and are intended to have the same effect as their predecessors. The section contains transitional provisions that apply if a rewritten provision is unclear or gives rise to absurdity. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31, No 4, May 2019 at 53 has a useful table comparing both repealed and current information collection and use provisions. The discussion below refers to the rewritten provisions. Purposes and principles of subpart 3A The stated purposes of the provisions in subpart 3A are:  ▪ to provide the Commissioner with the necessary powers to enable— □ the collection of all taxes or duties imposed by the Inland Revenue Acts □ the carrying into effect of any of the Inland Revenue Acts □ the carrying out of functions lawfully conferred on the Commissioner ▪ to enable the collection by the Commissioner of revenue information, including the power to— □ gain access to property or documents □ remove documents to make copies □ remove and retain documents for review ▪ to require a person or entity to produce documents or to provide or allow access to information to the Commissioner ▪ to set out the Commissioner’s powers to copy, remove or retain documents ▪ to provide a regulation-making power for the regular collection of bulk data ▪ to describe how revenue information may be used ▪ to protect the confidentiality of sensitive revenue information ▪ to facilitate efficient and effective government administration and law enforcement by allowing permitted disclosures of sensitive revenue information for certain specific or appropriate purposes: s 16. “Revenue information” is defined as information that is acquired, obtained, accessed, received by, disclosed to, or held by the  Commissioner under or for the purposes of a revenue law or under an information-sharing agreement: s 16C(2). “Revenue law” means the Inland Revenue Acts (listed in sch 1 of the TAA), the Accident Compensation Act 2001 and earlier such Acts, the New Zealand Superannuation Act 1974 and any Act imposing taxes or duties payable to the Crown: s 16C(1). A document is widely defined as meaning: ▪ a thing that is used to hold, in or on the thing and in any form, items of information or ▪ an item of information held in or on a thing, or ▪ a device associated with a thing referred to in the first bullet point. The collection of revenue information may be made for one or more of the following purposes: ▪ to protect the integrity of the tax system ▪ to carry into effect the revenue laws ▪ to carry out or support a function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner ▪ to encourage compliance with the revenue laws ▪ for any other function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner. See s 16B. Commissioner’s access to property and documents When collecting information, the Commissioner (and any authorised officer of IR) may access property or documents for the purpose of inspecting a document, property, process, or matter the Commissioner considers: ▪ is necessary or relevant for one of the purposes listed above, or  ▪ is likely to provide information that would otherwise be required for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts and any function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner. See s 17. The power of access is extremely wide. It applies despite anything in any other Act, and is subject only to restrictions in the case of a private dwelling (see below). For these purposes “property or documents” includes documents, whether in the custody or under the control of a public officer, a body corporate or any other person, and all lands, buildings, places or other premises. The occupier must provide all reasonable facilities and assistance for the effective exercise of the powers which the Commissioner may use under s 17(1) (access to property and documents) and s 17C (inspecting, copying and removing documents). The occupier must also answer all proper questions relating to the effective exercise of the powers under s 17, as required by the Commissioner. The Commissioner may be accompanied by another person if it is considered that the presence of the other person is necessary for the effective exercise of the powers under s 17. Private dwelling The Commissioner must not enter a private dwelling to access property or documents except with the occupier’s consent or under a warrant issued under s 17D. A private dwelling is a building or part of a building occupied as residential accommodation and includes: ▪ a garage, shed and other building used in connection with the private dwelling, and ▪ any business premises that are a private dwelling or are within a private dwelling. If an occupier has not given consent, a warrant to search the premises must be obtained from an issuing officer, who must be  satisfied that physical access to the premises is required for the exercise of a function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner. An issuing officer is defined as a judge or a person, such as a Justice of the Peace, Community Magistrate, Registrar, or Deputy Registrar, who is for the time being authorised to act as an issuing officer under s 108 of the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 (SSA). The criteria to be considered before the issuing of a search warrant were discussed in Tauber v C of IR (2011) 25 NZTC ¶20-071 (HC), (2012) 25 NZTC ¶20-143 (CA). The Court of Appeal also held, in Avowal Administrative Attorneys Ltd v District Court at North Shore (2010) 24 NZTC 24,252, that in exercising the access power there is an obligation on the Commissioner to act reasonably. The reasonableness depends on the circumstances of the case and is to be assessed having regard to the time, place and circumstances in which the search occurs. The reasonableness obligation is founded on s 21 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. The form of warrant is prescribed by subpart 3 of Pt 4 of the SSA, and s 103 of the SSA sets out what particulars the warrant must contain. Every person exercising the power of entry conferred by the warrant is required to produce the warrant and evidence of identity on first entering the private dwelling, and after
