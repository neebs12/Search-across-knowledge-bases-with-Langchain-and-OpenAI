That’s what I was expecting, and days have been similar, but there’s also a dark side… not like a horror movie dark, just sitting alone in a room forgetting to turn the lights on, no one around you type of dark. That’s the place I found myself in during my first month of freelancing. To update you all, I moved 20 minutes north out of Kerikeri, with my cat, birds, partner and soon to have 2 chickens. Rent here is cheap, my daily commute is from my kitchen to the lounge, and casual Friday’s are every day. I work between 20–30 hours a week for two companies (one in the states and another in Auckland), mostly doing visual design and research related work. It’s now my third month here, and third time lucky really applies to me, I’ve made some changes based on my challenges. As I reflect back, these are the three key things I learned, and wished I did in my first month working (super) remotely. 1. Find a mentor There is some beauty to working in an office, the ‘Hey, how was your weekend?’, ‘We’re going for after work drinks, want to come?’, the casual banter with the person working next to you, and that familiar face you see on the elevator every day — is no longer. What was driving me mad that first month was not having someone to bounce ideas off with, I needed someone to guide me along, ask me questions I don’t ask myself and surprisingly — ask me how my weekend was. So I reached out to my contacts and started Skyping with people that have inspired and continue to inspire me, what would usually be a coffee catch up in Wellington, is now a quick 30-minute remote call now and then. A special shout out to Chris Jackson from wecreatefutures, who has worked wonders in sparking my creativity, shifting my perspective and ensuring I keep up with the industry. 2.

Start the day with a ritual I followed people’s advice and tried working from cafes and co-working spaces (yes the far north has a co-working space believe it or not), but the work still wasn’t flowing. Also, we live 20 minutes from town, it’s a waste of petrol and I really like my space, it’s homely, I can play my music as loud as I want and I can work in my pyjamas, why would I give that up? I needed a way to detach from my home and into work, I’ve started getting up at the same time every day and making a plan to start work at the same time. My official work day starts after I’ve watered the plants, when I’m at my desk, with my email and Slack open, coffee in hand and the music flowing. My morning ritual helps me zone in and focus on the day to come. 3. Leave the taxes to Hnry No this is not a paid advertisement. Hnry is an online account software, they manage my invoices, pay my taxes and keep a record of my expenses. This software has changed my life, the stress and worries of ‘Am I doing it right?’ are gone and I can focus on simply doing my work. If you’re working as a freelancer or contractor, check Hnry out (use the code: SASJA1374 to get $25 credit, whoop!). Moving forward As I reflect back on that first month, all it took was time, time to figure out my flow, time for trial and error, time to make it my own. I’ve realised that the work hasn’t changed, but how I work is different in many ways. It has shown me that I don’t have to choose, I can choose to create my own path, whatever that looks like, it’s scary, because there’s no manual for this, but I love it. Now that I head into my fourth month, my chillies are thriving, the chicken coup is ready to go and my contracting work is as busy as ever. Let’s see what this next month will bring me.

You get to work on your own terms, follow your passion, be your own boss, and forge your own path. In the past, being a self-employed contractor, freelancer or sole trader could seem scary - a lot of people were put off by having to take on the hassle of tax and compliance. Having to worry about things like Income Tax, GST, ACC, Accountants and online calculators used to make self-employment a daunting prospect. You only have to do a quick Google search to find a load of articles and blog posts about self-employment, where the entire focus is on how you’ll need to learn the tax system before you start. Reading through these, it’s no wonder people used to think self-employment was difficult! Now that Hnry makes being self-employed as simple it having a permanent job, it’s time to focus on the other things you really need to know - here are 7 things you’ll want to think about: 1. Finding work may be easier than you think There are plenty of contracting and freelance jobs available that could be right for you, no matter whether you’re looking to work part time, full time or on an ad-hoc basis. Below are some great websites as a starting point where you can find the perfect work for you: The Big Idea: The Big Idea is New Zealand’s online hub for creative people, providing information, job postings and interesting content, specifically for the creative industry Fiverr: Why limit your awesome services to New Zealand? Just like the website says: “Don’t Just Dream, Do”. Market/Advertise your services on Fiverr. From graphic design to fortune telling, people are on Fiverr right now looking for what you offer TradeMe: Not only does the “Jobs” page of TradeMe allow you to filter and search for contract/temp work, but the “Services” page also allows you to advertise yourself and your services to anyone. Recruiters: Recruiters love finding people work; that’s their job! There are a bunch of recruiters out there that are happy to help you out. They specialise in understanding what you are looking for in a job and finding something that’s suited to you. You can get in touch with them yourself. Don’t be shy!

You’ll want to dedicate time to building your network A strong network is important to keep work rolling in consistently. Luckily, there are a wide variety of opportunities for you to establish and maintain a network, as well as being able to advertise your skills and services: Meetups: Find and meet like-minded people in person through Meetups near you. Find some Meetups that cater for your industry or specialty, and use the opportunity to collaborate and learn, to grow your skillset. Sometimes it is ‘who you know’ that can land you your perfect job. LinkedIn: The business equivalent of Facebook, but without the memes. List your work experience, your study, links to your website or work. When you meet clients, add them into your network and post 3. Don’t forget to develop your skills and invest in yourself Skills are what set you apart from others when looking for work, and soft skills are just as important as hard skills. Even once you have secured work, you’ll want to spend time investing in new skills, to develop your capabilities: Creative Pool have put together a really good blog on the vital soft skills that any contractor/freelancer needs to be successful. Having a great relationship with your clients is the key to getting future work, so make sure you build out your soft skills! Eventfinda is also good to find upcoming business conferences and workshops near you that can help develop soft/hard skills in your line of work. You may be able to claim back the cost of attending as a business expense too. 4. You don’t need to register as a business! A big misconception that people have as they head into self-employment, is that they need to be registered as a business to trade independently. This isn’t the case! Registering as a business unnecessarily can end up creating lots of work for yourself, not least because you’ll need to file tax returns for both your business, as well as for yourself as an individual. Some people mistakenly believe that registering yourself as a business provides you more legal protection, however if you are going to be a sole director, it doesn’t make any difference. When trading as an individual, you can choose a Trading","metadata":{"namespace":"hnry.co.nz_theleap","filename":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_7-tips-for-self-employment-nz_.txt","link":"https://hnry.co.nz/theleap/7-tips-for-self-employment-nz/.txt","id":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_7-tips-for-self-employment-nz__1"}}],["4",{"pageContent":"yourself as an individual. Some people mistakenly believe that registering yourself as a business provides you more legal protection, however if you are going to be a sole director, it doesn’t make any difference. When trading as an individual, you can choose a Trading Name, a Logo and have the ability to get tax relief on business expenses and purchases. If you’re a sole contractor or freelancer, there really isn’t any need to increase your hassle and costs by registering as a business. 5. Make sure you put aside some money for any times you’re not working Even though you won’t get paid if you take sick days or holidays, it’s really easy to set money aside just in case. The freedom of being self-employed means you get to choose when to take your holidays, where the only limit on the amount of time you take off being how much you can afford it! Work out your main household expenditure per month, and keep about 2-3 months’ worth of that amount in your savings, to cover you covered for any sick days, holidays and time between contracts where you may not be working. 6. Keep that KiwiSaver ticking over As a self-employed individual, you’ll want to be planning for the future. Paying into your KiwiSaver is a really simple way of making sure you’re thinking ahead. If you are unsure about KiwiSaver, you can find out more here. When deciding how much to pay into your KiwiSaver, it’s worth keeping in mind that you can receive $521.43 free each year from the government contribution. Here’s how the contribution works: The government will contribute $0.50 for every $1.00 that you contribute, up to a maximum of $521.43 To get the full $521.43, you will need to contribute a minimum of $1042.86 This roughly amounts to $20.00 per week that you’ll need to set aside If you’re a Hnry customer, you can nominate percentage of your income to go straight into your KiwiSaver every time you get paid, so that you never have to worry about it. 7. To GST, or not to GST? Let’s clear it up… If you are going to be earning over $60,000 per year, then the IRD says that you must register for Goods and Services Tax (GST). If you are earning less than $60,000 it isn’t mandatory","metadata":{"namespace":"hnry.co.nz_theleap","filename":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_7-tips-for-self-employment-nz_.txt","link":"https://hnry.co.nz/theleap/7-tips-for-self-employment-nz/.txt","id":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_7-tips-for-self-employment-nz__2"}}],["5",{"pageContent":"clear it up… If you are going to be earning over $60,000 per year, then the IRD says that you must register for Goods and Services Tax (GST).

If you’re registered for GST, you’ll need to charge 15% extra for the things you sell, however you can also claim the GST portion back, for any eligible business purchases you make. If you’re a Hnry customer and you want to register for GST, we’ve got a handy guide here. Self-employment is a blank canvas, and now that Hnry makes being self-employed simple and easy, there’s nothing to stop you from painting your very own masterpiece - so make the most of it! More and more people are earning money independently every day, whether as a side-hustle alongside a permanent job, or as a full-time freelancer or contractor. It’s an exciting adventure, and we’re sure you’ll never look back once your journey starts.","metadata":{"namespace":"hnry.co.nz_theleap","filename":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_7-tips-for-self-employment-nz_.txt","link":"https://hnry.co.nz/theleap/7-tips-for-self-employment-nz/.txt","id":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_7-tips-for-self-employment-nz__3"}}],["6",{"pageContent":"My journey into self-employment began in my home country of France. After my last year at the University of Bordeaux, I was ready to receive a computer science Master’s degree. And I had a choice. I could stay in France, where the computer science industry was tough to navigate, the work there often involving third party contracts for software and computing services companies. Or I could work abroad, where I’d need a good knowledge of English and where my French degree would be unknown. I understood my path in France would be rife with challenges, that I’d be working for years without much job security or benefits. The payoff there might not be worth the years of training to work my way up the ladder of experience. I knew then and there that I wanted to be a travelling freelancer. I wanted to work abroad. At a family reunion I shared my thoughts about leaving France. My father told me some of what I already knew (that I’d need good English skills, that it would be tough figuring out the unknowns on my own). He offered to help me get to Ireland, where I would spend a month immersing myself in the English language. We celebrated the opportunity; Champagne flutes were raised in toast. As if I needed more motivation to leave the rigid model of work in France, I had a last job interview right before leaving the country. The interview was awfully difficult to get. After back and forth discussions with four different people to speak about my experiences and motivations, I got to finally sit with someone before realising “no thank you, this is not for me.” After a month of English immersion in Ireland, my language skills were steadily improving. I began the search for my first job, which was a difficult task with no contacts, no professional experience and a foreign diploma. A few months later, after doing some personal projects and almost giving up and accepting my fate due to a lack of money, I found an awesome job at University College Dublin as a Junior Software Developer. That’s when “the craic” started. I made good friends and was beginning to establish a network. I’d spent six months living on a couch and building my experience, and for once I was feeling the momentum take shape. Although my contract was coming to an end, I had met a few people interested in my skills. This led me to eventually get offered my first “real” freelance contract.

Although my contract was coming to an end, I had met a few people interested in my skills. This led me to eventually get offered my first “real” freelance contract. With this contract, I spent two years in Dublin. I noticed that my experience was starting to draw the attention of some companies. My degree had finally paid off, and it soon occurred to me that getting a job wouldn’t be so much of a problem anymore. Keeping with the “digital nomad” mindset, I decided to take another leap and head to New Zealand. With my experience and the English skills I had picked up along the way, I managed to find a job at Hnry pretty quickly. Through my Hnry work, I soon realised how easy freelancing can be for others if given the right tools. I could use Hnry for all my invoices and didn’t have to figure out all the tax stuff that I knew was a big challenge before. I was always told that taxes were handled either by yourself or by an accountant, but for transient people like me this just wasn’t an option. Instead, I freed up my time for side projects like my diving certifications, studying AWS Architecture, and learning Japanese for my next adventure. The Leap into freelancing can be rewarding if you work hard enough at it. Sure, it was a tough road to get to where I am today. But each experience I had along the way was exciting and taught me new skills. If I had stayed in France, who knows the sorts of opportunities I would have had, the people I would have met, or the skills I would have learned. I look at my friends from university and some of them had such a hard time with their career paths that they left the computer science industry entirely. Because I took the Leap into the unknown, I’ve come out better than I would have otherwise. None of what I’ve learned will be lost.","metadata":{"namespace":"hnry.co.nz_theleap","filename":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_a-trampers-journey-through-the-freelance-wilderness_.txt","link":"https://hnry.co.nz/theleap/a-trampers-journey-through-the-freelance-wilderness/.txt","id":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_a-trampers-journey-through-the-freelance-wilderness__1"}}],["8",{"pageContent":"Brownyn Candish is a chartered accountant with Chartered Accountants ANZ and runs a cloud-based accountancy service in Christchurch called Cloudkeepers. She sat down with the Leap to share her thoughts about the future of accounting amidst the rise of the ‘shared economy’ and changes to accounting technology. Who are you, and what do you do? I’m Bronwyn. I’m a chartered accountant, but plenty of people don’t believe me when I tell them that! I grew up in the Manawatu, then the earthquakes drew me to Cristchurch four years ago. I just knew Christchurch would be an amazing place to be once the rebuild kicked off. My partner is Canadian, so we split our time between Christchurch, and with our families in Palmerston North and Vancouver. I work for myself from home, wherever that is at the time – mostly in my pyjamas. I am on the path to FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early), however I’m a relative newcomer to the movement. And seeing as I’m soon to be a first-time mum, I’m not sure I’ll ever actually retire in that sense of the word. Somebody said to me recently that the ‘RE’ in ‘FIRE’ should stand for recreational employment. It’s work you do for fun. That sounds like me. Can you talk a bit about the ‘shared economy’? What does the ‘shared economy’ mean for New Zealand’s economy and the workforce at large? I love the example of Book a Bach. We had a family bach that cost the in-laws heaps in dead weight costs, all while we were getting sick of visiting the same place all the time. So they sold up and we now use Book a Bach. It gives us the freedom to experience so much more, to be more intentional, and to maximise utilisation – I hate to see time and things go underutilised. There’s a place we’ve booked several times, year after year when the tradition was important, but we are free to go anywhere else and do whatever we want. I think that for the workforce, and particularly for me, the shared economy has been about taking control of your own destiny. I’ve been through a heart-breaking redundancy and have worked in places where the fit was so wrong I just felt ill. I love that now I only answer to myself, but that also means it’s all on me to make things happen.

I love that now I only answer to myself, but that also means it’s all on me to make things happen. Breaking away from the norm gives us the ability to see that anything is up for grabs, be it the location you work from, the clients you choose to work with or the technology you use to do so. It also gives you the ability to pivot quickly when new directions or technologies present themselves. The hardest part of working for yourself is figuring out what it is that you want and then to actually let yourself do it unapologetically. Where do you see the future of accounting, especially when it comes to independent earners in today’s shared economy? Independent earners need to be using an accountant or a solution that aligns with their size and goals for growth. Why are you using cumbersome systems that designed for big business? Why pay for the office and infrastructure of big firms when you could be utilising the skills of someone whose work is cloud-based, and can get the job done from their home? I’m obviously bias, but there is still an appalling number of accountants out here not making the most of technology – simply rehashing their client’s books without adding any value. Independent earners need to simplify their lives as much as possible. Don’t overcook it. And please, use collaborative software for goodness sake. I see ways of working together in the future to be more about real-time collaboration that helps people get sh!t done, rather than looking back at last year’s accounts. The robots will be doing those. We accountants have been translating financial data into actionable, understandable information since ages ago. Some are just more focused on what’s coming rather than what’s been. I’m all about the drive and direction for the future. There’s not much we can do about last year now. There are so many sources of financial information out there (friends, internet forums, etc.). What’s your ethos towards financial education? It’s the same advice I’d give for any facet of your life: only take the advice of the people whose opinion actually matters to you.

Professionally, I work with all types of industries but have specific expertise in businesses that “sell time”: these are professional services such as architecture firms, project managers, lawyers, tradies and creative types. My goal with these clients is to set a compulsory budget, a KPI dashboard, and a clear understanding of their own goals and values as a minimum for all of my clients – anything less would be irresponsible. I also challenge them to apply the same rigour in which they scrutinise their business finances to their personal financial lives. My favourite clients are those who want to regularly talk to me about how their business is tracking, because they see their business, side hustle, real estate portfolio as a tool on their journey to financial independence. We talk just as openly about their personal finances, their FIRE journey, or retirement “number”, as the aspirations they have for their kids. What is your best piece of advice for today’s independent earners? Your next move should be to find someone who isn’t living payday to payday, or paying interest on consumer debt, and pay more attention to them. People who live within their means are a rarity out here. Memento Mori - don’t work a day longer or pay a cent more in taxes than you have to (legally of course).

It’s an entirely open-access artist-led festival. As Sasha put it: “we’re here to support and empower artists.” Creatives pay a small fee to be part of the festival (which covers the cost of printing the program guide and administration costs) and then get to keep the profit of their ticket sales. Funding from Creative New Zealand and sponsors like Hnry help Fringe make all the workshops free of charge to artists. The workshops start in September - when registrations for the festival open - and run to the end of March. “We want to know that they’re taking care of themselves during their career,” said Sasha. So we cover topics across the spectrum, all the way from growing their creative skill sets to writing and sending invoices.” What Fringe does for artists Encouraging local creatives is what Fringe is all about. Fringe provides huge resources for these artists - things like mentoring, career guidance, and the workshops - not to mention a cutting edge festival to perform at. The workshops are divided into three phases. Phase one covers the idea stage, which answers the basic question “I’ve got an idea - how do I get started?” Phase two covers anything artists need to know while they’re working on their performance. Phase three is all about life after Fringe and planning out artists’ next steps. At their request, Fringe is offering a range of “hard-skill” workshops this year. For example, one of the new workshops is an intimacy workshop which Sasha hopes will teach artists how to keep themselves, their performance, and their audience safe when they have intimate scenes in their work - scenes which might be difficult to perform or triggering for audience members. Sasha said she can see the impact of the workshops on those who come along to every single one and fully engage with them. “I just love watching and following the careers of those people,” she said. For Sasha, the festival’s identity is all about providing an open-access platform for New Zealand artists to take part in a cutting edge festival - and providing early career growth and support for emerging artists. “I’m particularly passionate about making sure our artists come out of Fringe with the tools that they need to create sustainable careers.” Starting her career selling box office tickets, Sasha’s talents were soon put to better use","metadata":{"namespace":"hnry.co.nz_theleap","filename":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_artist-empowerment-fuels-wellington-fringe_.txt","link":"https://hnry.co.nz/theleap/artist-empowerment-fuels-wellington-fringe/.txt","id":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_artist-empowerment-fuels-wellington-fringe__0"}}],["12",{"pageContent":"growth and support for emerging artists. “I’m particularly passionate about making sure our artists come out of Fringe with the tools that they need to create sustainable careers.” Starting her career selling box office tickets, Sasha’s talents were soon put to better use organising everything under the sun for touring artists. She’s been part of the Fringe festival in various roles since 2014, which has given her a chance to experience all the “ebbs and flows” of running a festival. She had every reason to be confident when she took the role of director in July last year - but nothing could have prepared her for the uncertainty and upheaval COVID brought at the beginning of 2020. Long-term Fringe sponsors were struck hard financially, which meant Sasha had to think of creative ways to continue relationships with long-term patrons and make up for the downfall in funding. “Cash is tight for artists, patrons - everyone.” Determined to make it work, she stepped into her new role set to navigate this new normal while maintaining the festival’s integrity. And she succeeded. Brimming with submissions this year, Fringe 2021 is set to be the biggest festival to date with a new record of 162 submissions. Covering 25 genres it has something for everyone - dance, mime, puppetry, circus, theatre, literature, live art, improvisation - the list goes on. The festival also includes family-friendly events such as yoga for kids and “Chalk the Walk,” where little ones can show their creativity with chalk on the pavement at the Waterfront. Supporting local With current travel restrictions in place it means that Fringe’s usual fare of international artists haven’t been able to make it to New Zealand, which makes the new submissions record even more special, because it comes primarily from local artists. “Almost 80 percent of our program this year is Wellington locals, another 18 percent is coming from across the country, and finally there are a couple of live-streamed events happening from overseas,” said Sasha. That 2% is a stark difference to the usual 30% of overseas acts making an appearance at Fringe. On the flip side, it’s resulted in a massive uptake in local artists wanting to showcase their work. This year’s festival comes as a welcome breath of fresh air, especially for those artists that had their national and international performances cancelled last year. “I think that lockdown had something to do with the incredible local uptake,” said Sasha. “Most of","metadata":{"namespace":"hnry.co.nz_theleap","filename":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_artist-empowerment-fuels-wellington-fringe_.txt","link":"https://hnry.co.nz/theleap/artist-empowerment-fuels-wellington-fringe/.txt","id":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_artist-empowerment-fuels-wellington-fringe__1"}}],["13",{"pageContent":".

She hopes that Fringe, in being a cutting-edge festival combined with a breadth of career support, will help artists see themselves building their future in Wellington. “You can create all this amazing work and be a freelancer and do it yourself - staying right here. After all, we’re still the creative capital of New Zealand.”","metadata":{"namespace":"hnry.co.nz_theleap","filename":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_artist-empowerment-fuels-wellington-fringe_.txt","link":"https://hnry.co.nz/theleap/artist-empowerment-fuels-wellington-fringe/.txt","id":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_artist-empowerment-fuels-wellington-fringe__2"}}],["14",{"pageContent":"The workers, the majority of whom hold six to nine-month contracts with C&C, have worked for the organisation off and on for most of their careers. The work is high-demand and the workers hold long hours, often times late into the night. One crafter, Alabaster Snowball, who started at C&C in his late sixties, has managed to rise to the rank of Master Crafter. “I started out just working on the Shop floor,” reflects Snowball, on his career at C&C. “It was mostly maintenance and clean-up at the end of the day, that kind of thing. And over a great many years I slowly rose to the position of Builder, then Advanced Builder, and then just this year I was appointed Master Crafter. Mr. Snowball is just one of the hundreds of craftspeople employed by C&C, the largest toy manufacturer in the Northern Hemisphere. When asked what he likes most about his job, Snowball was quick to say that “the seasonality” made the work all worth it. The work at Claus & Claus (C&C) is actually pretty steady, pretty varied. I like being busy, always learning new skills when I’m not on a C&C contract. The months off really let me do that. Often jumping from contract to contract with C&C, Snowball (aged 526) also runs a side business with his wife, who is also employed by C&C, where the couple makes toy planes from their home workshop. “We get good time off in the quieter months. Management is pretty happy to see us earn income through other means.” The flexible work that the Snowballs and other C&C employees get to enjoy is crucial for developing learning opportunities during those off months. One of the most competitive industries in the Northern Hemisphere, toy manufacturing often sees hundreds of workers missing out on contract renewals each year. Moreover, the hours can be long so workers often don’t have the time to plan for their futures outside of the work – let alone learn new skills within their craft. “It can be stressful,” explains Mr Snowball. “But we’re always looking to improve our skills through various side projects. For every job you want, there are about a hundred other workers out there who could do the same job but better. So a lot of the work is trying to balance that, trying to make the most of our time so that we can get the good contracts.

The toy business is a pretty competitive one.” The industry is also a changing one, with innovations in technology arising each day. “There are so many different types of toys that children want these days. RC planes are still doing well but we worry that children will eventually prefer drones.” After the Snowballs and some colleagues discovered Hnry, they’ve since found themselves with more free time to pursue research interests and learning opportunities. Hnry helps people like the Snowballs handle all tax and compliance obligations on their flexible earnings, helping creative contractors feel a great sense of relief and allowing them to focus on what matters most to them: the art of the craft and developing those new skills. Like their peers, the Snowballs used to consistently feel the burden of financial admin – the work outside of work. Most C&C craftspeople have contracts that do not contain a section that indicates their income will be taxed by the employer’s payroll department – a clause often referred to as a “Claus Clause” in the industry. Due to the nature of flexible work in the Shop (the informal name given to the coworking space at C&C), only permanent employees have the benefit of having the financial admin taken care of for them. As one of Mr. Snowball’s colleagues, Pepper Minstix, puts it, this creates a lot of time and mental anguish for the more seasonal workers who just don’t have the wherewithal to maintain their financial admin. “All of that tax stuff gives us a real headache,” explains Minstix, aged 205, who makes yo-yos in the Shop. “In our line of work, days are filled with singing and candy canes. We’d rather focus on that fun stuff rather than having to worry about invoicing and taxation.” Hnry, which launched earlier this year (2018), is aimed at people exactly like Minstix: contractors and freelance creators who, up until this point, had to figure out the financial admin on their own.

It can be so easy to rack up debt, but much harder to pay it off. When you earn an independent (or ‘lumpy’) income, it becomes even more difficult to know when you’ll even be able to repay those debts or make those direct debits without risking overdraft. If you’re interested in tackling your debt right away, it’s important to actually understand what debt is, how it comes about, and the ways in which you can pay it off. So What is Debt and How Can I Get Out Of It? At its most basic, debt is a form of financial overextension. You spend your future dollars today, which always comes at a cost. The scenario often goes something like this: You can’t afford to buy an item or service, so you use a credit card and rack up some debt. You then dig into your existing income in order to pay off that credit card debt. Now you’re worse off than when you started: you still can’t afford to buy stuff, so you continue to buy stuff that you can’t afford. The cycle of debt continues; the quicksand keeps rising while you keep sinking. When you earn an inconsistent income, you might have to closely oversee your payments and rely on others to remember to pay you for your work. In these instances, there is no fixed ‘pay-date’ – not only might you have different amounts of pay coming in each time, but the frequency of those payments is also variable. Many people who find themselves in this situation might use short term debt as a reactive measure to help them overcome those inconsistent earnings periods. If you work a contract here and there, you might encounter a fortnight or even a month where you’ll have no other choice but to take out a loan or use your credit card to pay for essential utilities. In this instance, it can be very difficult to avoid going into that kind of debt, as these are unavoidable purchases or payments. After all, you can’t go without electricity or food. To enjoy a good quality lifestyle throughout the different stages of life, to have just a little bit of financial freedom as your career develops, credit card payments can be an incredibly necessary evil – if deployed at the right time. Credit card debt, however, can be avoided. So what if you could plan, in advance, for those moments of financial ebb and flow?

Credit card debt, however, can be avoided. So what if you could plan, in advance, for those moments of financial ebb and flow? Creating a Plan Of course, the easiest way to avoid accumulating debt is to spend within your limits, whenever and wherever you can. For both avoiding debt and paying off debt, here are some methods you might look at putting into place today, which might help you out tomorrow: To Avoid Debt Set up an emergency fund, in which you pool money on a regular basis to help smooth over those periods of lower income, or to help you afford bigger shops like those around the festive season or the set-up costs of a new home. You also never know when you might need to get specific services done, like emergency car maintenance or house repairs. Therefore, it’s crucial to have an emergency savings fund that you can dip into as needed. Our friends at Sorted recommend having a starter safety net of $1,000. Strategise your spending: only borrow for items that you absolutely need and can see yourself actually paying off in the next month. Map out your finances: where are you currently spending the majority of your money? How much are you putting aside versus spending, right now? Are there any unnecessary regular purchases that you can deprioritise? Make the most of free online tools. If all of this is feeling overwhelming, there are some tools that can help you get a leg up on your debts and perhaps help you to avoid them altogether. Sorted have some handy tools that can help you out: Sorted’s budgeting tool and the Debt calculator To Pay Off Existing Debt **Establish a strategy. **After calculating the amount of debt you might be owing, set up a repayment schedule. Check to see what the minimum monthly payment is (what you need to pay in order to keep the debt at bay and not risk incurring additional debt). Always at least match that. Moreover, different types of purchases will give you a different interest rate on the subsequent debt. Knowing the interest rates of your various debts and how they may affect your ability to pay them off is crucial to saving yourself time, stress and money. Don’t stretch yourself thin in an attempt to sort out all your debt at once. Just like quicksand, the harder you try and escape debt’s clutches, the faster you may sink.

Just like quicksand, the harder you try and escape debt’s clutches, the faster you may sink. Try and choose which type of interest you’d like to tackle first: higher interest debts (this is called the ‘avalanche’ method) or lower interest debts (the ‘snowball’). Establish ‘sensible spending’ habits and stick with them. Change your perspective. The acute dangers of debt (and the benefits of planning in advance) become even more apparent when examined through the lens of consumption smoothing. Consumption Smoothing Consumption smoothing is the idea that through better balancing your consumption patterns and your saving trends at different stages in your life, you might achieve a greater quality of life over the course of your entire lifetime. As a young person, this distinction could be between living more cheaply today while putting money away for KiwiSaver on a regular basis. Or, later on in life, perhaps investing in non-liquid assets (such as real estate and land), while continuing to live relatively cheaply, which will increase one’s net worth in the long run. When thinking with a ‘consumption smoothing’ lens, it becomes more apparent why generally avoiding debt early on in life is the smartest move you can make in your career. If you can avoid it, why overextend and risk being on the hook for payments you cannot make? But consumption smoothing comes with a pretty important caveat. It can be risky to offload financial responsibility onto your “future self” when you can take the steps earlier on in life to better prepare for that inevitable day. So for now, try and get into the habit of making smart savings decisions while you have the ability. The future is, of course, unpredictable. And your future self isn’t the most reliable. So stick with what you know today; the bills you have to pay this month. Rather than waiting for an idealised future, try to plan for that future now. Who knows if you’ll have job security for the next few years? Or if your field goes through a great deal of innovation or change and you need retraining in order to progress your career further?

Quickly transforming the face of creative education, enrichme is focused on building community through co-learning opportunities – lifting the hassle of booking, payment tracking and course marketing off the shoulders of creative educators. In this interview, Tomas sits down to talk about the process of establishing enrichme and about his love of – and dreams for – continuous arts learning in New Zealand and around the world. What was the initial idea behind enrichme? How does it work? enrichme is based on the idea that work should be meaningful. There’s a market failure in the creative economy that sees art consumed by those with the most wealth, and created largely by those with the least. It’s really not right, especially considering how integral art is to a healthy and well-functioning society. enrichme provides creative people with a simple way to list courses, take bookings, and process payments, allowing them to focus on what they do best. On the other side, we make it easy for people to learn a new creative skill and meet new people through in situ learning. What have you learned in the process of starting your own business that you feel newcomers should hear? I don’t think I’m far enough along the journey to be any sort of authority on this, however I can say that one of the key things I’ve learned so far is that perseverance is critical. Building a business takes a huge amount of time and energy, and the risks are enormous. Rather than aiming for success, I think it’s important to enjoy the journey, and I think perseverance is necessary to overcome the challenging times, of which there will undoubtedly be many. Especially in trying to establish a business and maintain an existing job, how do you manage your multiple obligations? The level of difficulty in managing multiple obligations really depends on what kind of business you’re building. In my case, it made sense to do both as there’s a strong relationship between my current employer and my business that allows for a lot of crossover. Learning how and what to delegate has been key, and something I’m always trying to improve.

What courses seem to be gathering the most attention on your site?

You’ve got nothing to lose and it only takes a few minutes to get set up on enrichme. Plenty of our customers work a permanent job as well, but they’ve managed to reduce it to part-time hours while sustaining their income by teaching what they are truly passionate about (e.g. a lawyer turned part-time yoga instructor or office admin turned part-time drawing teacher).

When it comes to investing, what do you see as some of the biggest challenges for those who are self-employed, contracting or freelancing? When you’re self employed or contracting, it’s easy to fall into the trap of paying everything else first and then wanting to save with what’s left over – particularly if you’re worried about lumpy income. What usually happens though, is despite our best intentions, the money always finds a way to be spent on other things! The best way to counteract this is to apply the principle of Pay Yourself First – where investing an amount for ‘future you’ is the first thing that’s done when any money hits your bank account. Luckily we know of some software that’s perfect to help with this! What are some of the general trends you are seeing when it comes to individuals and investments? A couple of things come to mind – there are some really diligent savers out there that are coming to realise the money they’ve worked hard to save, money that’s sitting in a bank account, is earning them nothing. In fact, it’s probably going backwards. More people, especially those that are a bit younger, are realising there’s better use for this money. The other main thing is seeing people just start and build from what they have - whether that be $100, $1,000 or $10,000, there’s no right or wrong place to get started.

With these tips in mind, you can be sure that you’re making the most of your income. What is personal financial management? When we talk about personal financial management, we’re referring to any strategies or plans you have in place for budgeting, saving and spending your income. Managing your financial future isn’t just about planning around the income you earn today. It’s more of a mindset that you can pull through into your daily life, and hopefully allow yourself some financial and mental freedom from having to worry about peaks and troughs of inconsistent earning. Good personal financial management involves taking stock of your present situation and putting a plan in place – a strategy that you can actually manage – so that your future self can reap the benefits. Why is this important? As it turns out, being in control of your personal finances has been proven to improve mental well-being. Moreover, it helps shore up your time – giving you peace of mind now and saving you stress and confusion later on. 1. Set manageable, measurable goals Setting realistic goals is one of the best habits that a successful independent earner can develop. These goals can range from savings goals to investment goals, to education and travel goals, or even home renovation ambitions. Whatever your goals, be clear about the milestones you’d like to set and surpass on your journey to completing them. Questions to consider: What am I actually looking to achieve with my investments and savings? Think about where you’re at in your life and career. Are you looking to buy a house within the next five years? Ten years? Are you looking to start a family? Do you want to save up for a career break? Do you want to diversify your investments?

How will I measure my progress?

Invest in yourself, for both today and tomorrow. Goal-setting is one thing, but actually achieving these goals is another matter entirely. Now it’s time to actually put your plans in play. The first step is to set up a system that makes it really easy to make regular contributions towards the progress of your goals. For some, this involves software or spreadsheets that calculate how much to apportion into your various cheque and savings accounts on a regular basis. Other contractors just muddle through, subtracting percentages on the back of an envelope and seeing a progress bar fill up in their banking app. However you look at it, a level of automation is still required. Why should I set up automatic payments that directly contribute to all of life’s obligations? It can be really easy to get overwhelmed by tax and insurance payments, ACC levies, and monthly expenses such as rent, utilities, transport, and food. We’ve noticed that many independent earners are so focused on these obligations that they are often unable to pay into their KiwiSaver schemes, or make investments into stocks, funds, even investing in their own skill sets.

Smooth out any income inconsistencies and plan ahead. One of the best habits you can develop is in planning ahead of any potential income inconsistencies. We’ve talked about this topic before, but at its essence, smoothing out income over time is super relevant to feeling financially successful when you’re earning independently. Let’s say you’re an IT contractor, and around the Christmas break you know you won’t be paid for at least a couple of weeks. Given this knowledge, it makes sense to plan ahead: throughout the year, you set set aside a percentage of your income into a ‘rainy day’ fund. By the time the Christmas shutdown rolls around, you’ll still be able to make ends meet and not feel the pressure of a couple of weeks of no income. If you balance out your spending and savings patterns throughout the year, your future self will be better off for it.","metadata":{"namespace":"hnry.co.nz_theleap","filename":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_financial-habits_.txt","link":"https://hnry.co.nz/theleap/financial-habits/.txt","id":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_financial-habits__2"}}],["29",{"pageContent":"For a lot of self-employed people, it can be a struggle to make ends meet and plan for their future with a variable income. Luckily, there are organisations out there who specialise in giving sound financial advice to self-employed people so that they can get a leg up on their financial futures. We spoke to Dean Blair at Foxplan (one of those organisations helping countless individuals plan for their futures), who shared with us some financial tips that can help self-employed people gain financial autonomy through deliberate planning and proactive insights. In your experience, what are some of the challenges that self-employed people have when it comes to planning for the future? One of the main challenges that we see quite often is this misperception that planning for the future isn’t possible. A lot of self-employed people earn variable income that can change monthly and even weekly. Planning for the future is still possible, so before going contracting or starting a business, building a cash reserve is important: this allows you to handle periods of no or lower income and still pay the bills in order to live. Have a plan – not just a business plan, but a personal financial plan. What sorts of factors should a self-employed person consider when deciding how much income to put towards their future? As you develop a plan, determine your short, medium and long-term goals. Make sure you add quantitative value to them: ask, “how much do I need for each goal?” Now you can calculate how much weekly, fortnightly or monthly income you need to allocate to those goals. Do an audit of what it costs to cover your fixed expenses (utilities, rent/mortgage, insurances) each month. Now you should be able to work out the percentage to allocate to each area each week, fortnight or month. What advice would you give to someone who is beginning to think about their future and isn’t sure where to start? It all starts with now. Work out your current financial position and net worth (what you own vs. what you owe). Then write down all the things you have always wanted to do in your lifetime – your dreams and desires – no matter how crazy they may seem. Next, review these dreams and separate them into non-negotiable and negotiable. Start with the non-negotiable desires: why are they important to you and how urgent is it to make them a reality?

Start with the non-negotiable desires: why are they important to you and how urgent is it to make them a reality? Break down the actions that are needed to make each dream a reality and set realistic milestones so you can immediately start working towards them. Think of it as a fitness program: there will be pain along the way and you’ll need discipline, but the payoff is well worth it in the end. That’s an intriguing way of thinking about financial planning – that’s its similar in a lot of ways to a fitness plan. What sort of advice would you give people to help them stay on track? All the best athletes have a reliable coach. Even professional teams and business people have an accountability partner. Find a coach who you know will give you unbiased yet supportive advice. When things get tough, they’ll be the person who will ensure that you stick to your plan. Make sure to measure your progress along the way and celebrate reaching your milestones with your coach. In your opinion, is there anything we can do better in NZ to help people plan for their financial future? Add financial planning to the school curriculum and get kids thinking about their financial futures at a young age. I have seen the success of this when we ran financial fitness boot camp with 120 Year 7 & 8 students. They were really engaged and soaked up the information. Don’t be afraid to get advice. The Kiwi psyche is very DIY, “she’ll be right,” and “we can figure it out later”. In my experience, having a coach or adviser makes a huge difference in peoples’ lives. The best part for us is seeing our clients reach their milestones and live the life they want to live. We’ve created a safe place at Foxplan where people can talk about money and realise it can be fun and certainly not as hard as they thought it would be. Money can be fun.

As the co-founder and director of Rhythm & Vines (which celebrates its seventeenth year in December) Pinkham is now shifting his gaze to creative conferences and idea-driven forums, with The Phoenix Summit. The Summit, described as an ‘uprising of creative minds’, offers a day-long collection of collaborations, performances, and fire-side chats with some of today’s thought leaders in the global entertainment and media industries. With the Summit’s inaugural event coming up later this month (September 14th at Auckland’s Q Theatre), Pinkham sat down with The Leap to discuss the inspiration behind the event, and to share some insights on how he started out as a young music enthusiast/lawyer and took the ‘leap’ into full-time event production on the world stage. What is the Phoenix Summit and how did it come into fruition? Phoenix Summit was born out of this idea that we wanted to gather some like minds into a room and share some stories and inspiration around the creative industries. We wanted to generate some leading conversation – be it around the social impact of creative work, or women in the industry, cutting edge technology in the industry – and present some speakers that are leading the way, in order to help inspire the next generation of Kiwi creatives. What can people expect to experience at this first Summit? In this inaugural event, we’ve got some fantastic minds to help spearhead some of these conversations: from leading music managers like Ty Stiklorius, John Legend’s manager, to leading creatives such as Lady Gaga’s mentor, who has worked on a number of her brands and commercials. We’ve also got some top policy makers in the local music industry, as well as some fantastic performers. I think if we get them all under one roof, with a hungry, inspired audience, we’re going to have some fantastic breakthroughs. What was it about your journey that inspired the Phoenix Summit? Thinking back to my journey as a young entrepreneur in the entertainment industry, I didn’t really have the kind of mentors or the platform to grow my ideas at a fast rate.

As I’ve gone on in my journey as a music and events entrepreneur, I’ve picked up a lot of skills and contacts. So I thought it’d be a good chance now to give back to the industry and create something so that the next generation can achieve their goals. So did you take a similarly entrepreneurial approach to Phoenix Summit, as you did with developing Rhythm & Vines? Yeah, there are certainly plenty of similarities between Phoenix Summit and Rhythm & Vines in this sense, you know starting out organically and addressing a need in the market – having a vision and surrounding yourselves by like-minded people. My role as the founder and visionary is to take that first step, and as you can see with Phoenix we’ve got some really good minds and commercial partnerships underway. The approach we’re taking is really just about getting this idea and these conversations out into the market and seeing what feedback we get, and then we can mold out the concept as we go. That’s certainly what we’ve done with Rhythm & Vines – it’s gone through many different iterations and it’s grown into a multi-day, camping festival. It certainly didn’t begin like that. Once these things develop a life of their own, it’s really exciting to see where you can take them. How will the Phoenix Summit be different to Rhythm & Vines (R&V)? Phoenix Summit explores more of an ‘educainment’ niche compared to Rhythm & Vines. It’s hopefully going to be an insightful, inspiring, and entertaining day, but there’s also that educational aspect to it: we’re really trying to encourage people to grow and learn. It’s certainly not a festival, it’s more of a conference of sorts. Anyone who’s ambitious and serious about achieving their creative goals I think would want to be there to pick up those little tidbits of information and inspiration that will help them along their creative journey.

It’d be great to see the Phoenix Summit putting New Zealand creatives, culture, ideas and industry on the world map; having a home base in New Zealand but being a brand that’s recognised throughout the world and being extended throughout the world; and being a platform for Kiwi ideas to flourish and rise up. I see the event being over multiple days and encompassing multiple genres in the creative industries: from music to film, from advertising to innovation and technology, to the creative arts and being a forum for all conversations – an aspirational platform for all and a unique Kiwi think tank that’s held annually here in New Zealand. It’s certainly developing a life of it’s own as we build and grow, but we’ve got a pretty clear vision and that’s what we’re so passionate and excited about, and that’s what we can’t wait to deliver on on the 14th and from there keep moving onto the next one. What makes New Zealand the ideal place for an event such as this? I think New Zealand is a really popular destination for the creative industries. I’ve met a lot of people in my travels who would like to come here, and so I thought if I could establish a platform for people, that would attract this level of industry expert, then it would be a great meeting of minds. I’m passionate about New Zealand and the creative industries here and the Summit is all about promoting the creative industries as a career path. There’s a lot of interest: just in this initial year we’ve got three or four guests joining us from offshore and I know their networks are super interested in the Phoenix journey and where it may go, and they’re all interested in being involved. So who knows where this concept could go, once we get it off the ground? How will the Phoenix Summit help New Zealand’s creative industries inform its culture? You know, making art a focus for peoples’ careers and bringing their passions to the forefront, and empowering them to not be afraid of being in the creative industries.

I see some great ideas coming through and if we can bridge the gap here between young up-starts and some seasoned creatives then we’ll be doing our job with the Phoenix Summit. Let’s talk a bit about the ‘Leap’ you took into working for yourself. What were you doing before you got into event organising? I studied as a lawyer at Otago University, and we came up with the idea for R&V while I was in my second-to-last year at university, while still studying law. So I found myself working on the festival more than my studies. I still continued studying law and got my degree and actually did graduate as a lawyer, but my passion and interest in the music business had taken over. So I put law aside and pursued my passion as a promoter. There were certainly some ups and downs in those early years and hanging on and focusing on my vision and I think if I had that full time job I might not have given it the full commitment. So as a result I was able to get my head above water for the business and get established and it sort of set us up nicely for the R&V journey. And looking back, I’ve been able to apply a lot of my training to my role and having the confidence to go into deals and contracts and the like. These things just sort of take on a life of their own, and now I’m more in the conference market but the legal beginnings I had are never too far away. It’s given me the confidence to go into a lot of these ventures. Law teaches you a lot about problem-solving and keeping a clear head, and taking things one bite at a time, and that’s what this business is all about. Maintaining relationships and establishing opportunities and all the legalities that come with it as well. It’s been a great training for me as well. Were there any early teachings you picked up that you could share with the Leap audience? Anything that stood out as an early learning point for you? I think having mentors was quite a key thing for me, early on. At the time","metadata":{"namespace":"hnry.co.nz_theleap","filename":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_hamish-pinkham-phoenix-summit_.txt","link":"https://hnry.co.nz/theleap/hamish-pinkham-phoenix-summit/.txt","id":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_hamish-pinkham-phoenix-summit__3"}}],["35",{"pageContent":"as well.

I think having mentors was quite a key thing for me, early on. At the time we had this unbridled optimism and naivete and a bit of blind confidence heading into our idea, and I think having a couple of more experienced business owners and event operators around us, just to keep us in check and keep our feet on the ground was part of our initial journey. I think that’s what we’re trying to do with the Phoenix Summit as well. People may have all of these ideas to bring to the table but if we can have some more experienced heads that have sort of been there and done that, maybe provide some reality checks or talk about the hurdles they experienced throughout their journey then I think we’re helping to shape these ideas faster and more effectively. In my journey, having my father and my friend’s father helping us in our journey was key as well. That idea of having some event experts surrounding us and helping us with different areas – from booking artists to delivering camping and transportation, and then, as the business grew, to more of a governance and support level and now we’ve got an industry player in LiveNation behind us. It’s always been an important part of our journey having that kind of support framework as we’ve grown. Were there ever any doubts in your mind about taking the leap? Was there ever a moment when you thought about going down the law path or were you always focused on event management? I was almost avoiding the legal path. I was interested in the work and the experience but I knew I wouldn’t be able to move at a fast pace towards my goals if I got caught up in that career path so it was a pretty clear decision. There’s always lots of pressures, be it from friends or peer groups or from family, and financial and travel restrictions. Choosing that entrepreneurial path is a hard road and although I was fully focused and committed to it, there were lots of challenges along the way. What advice would you give to someone who is looking to take ‘the Leap’? Throw yourself into the network.

I’d say it’s also about not being scared to make those introductions and to keep learning and applying yourself and I think Phoenix Summit is going to combine all of those elements. It’s going to be a place, an event for people to gather and network and be inspired and learn, and I know when I was coming up on my journey if I had had a forum like this in New Zealand it would have done wonders for my idea and I’m hoping we can apply that for the next generation coming through. Where to next with the Phoenix Summit? Yeah there’s loads of topics we can be discussing at different panels and break-out sessions; we could have more live performers and invite people from different industries across the creative realm. But I think in Year 1 we’re just trying to keep things simple. There’s a music focus, there’s one stage, one day, one time frame and even the venue is easy to get to, here in Auckland – we are really trying to keep things simple in our first year. And I’m sure once we get through that we can start to see where the forum can go. We’ve got ideas of bringing mini-summits throughout the country, you know, this idea of bringing Phoenix Summit and the brand on tour.

This was delivered as the safety-net when a contract goes sour or work has dried up. For me, this has meant that I can operate from a position of integrity – I don’t need to stay in a contract if I no longer feel I can contribute value to the organisation. Work out what suits your personality and always re-evaluate! I’ve opted for shorter stints. Three and four month terms almost always ensure one clear deliverable.

I was 29 years old, in a well-paid and stable job, and I was bored shitless.

But after having relocated here to New Zealand, the circumstances this time around were slightly different. Back then in the UK (post the Y2K bug non-event), I was stuck in an appalling job with an appalling boss and took the first opportunity to escape, which turned out to be a contract. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend this as an approach. I mean, sure I earned lots, had a lot of holidays and bought a lot of cars. But equally, I lived away from home during the week for nine years and drove back and forth every weekend to places 300 miles away. It wasn’t a great quality of life. After safe-havening through the GFC (and given a slight change in personal circumstances), I quit my job, sold my house and emigrated to Wellington. This time I took a couple of years to establish a network of contacts and to get used to the Wellington market (the latter was harder than the former!), before I decided to begin contracting here. As a lot of friends and ex-colleagues have asked me whether contracting is worth it or not, here’s my advice in a handy bullet-point format: Think hard about whether contracting suits you. You do not get paid sick days, paid holidays, or any benefits. Don’t just look at the headline hourly/daily rate and compare it to your base salary. You might have to get professional indemnity insurance, for example, and you may wish to have a company such as Hnry take some of the financial homework off your hands, or you may wish to pay an accountant to do your books. Either way, do the maths properly before you make a decision. You will rarely get paid training as a contractor. If you’re good at Task A you may contract as a Task A expert; however if Task A is no longer needed in the marketplace you will need to fund your re-training yourself as well as establish a reputation as an expert in your new field. Bear this in mind if you’re contracting in a technical field. Coding languages fade in and out of prominence very quickly these days.

This is a GOOD thing. Never underestimate the power of a positive work environment – not being hated by 70% of your colleagues just because of your employment status is a good first step. In New Zealand you can contract as a sole trader, which means that you don’t need to register as a company (unless you want to, of course). This cuts the full accounting expense out and prevents you from having to file taxes for two entities (yourself and your registered business). All you need is a GST number, which takes 5 minutes online to obtain, and a bit of advice regarding which BIC code to choose (this determines your percentage ACC contribution - see my first point!) and you’re pretty much good to go. It is SO much easier to get set up here than it was in the UK. The IRD are actually quite nice people and help you resolve any issues. For example, this year my appointed payroll company (a common occurence on contracts with big organisations, as you can’t always pick who you work with) failed to count to 12 and sent the wrong information on my earnings to IRD. Having been forensically audited three times in the UK by an Inland Revenue staff member who was convinced that I was trying to hide some earnings (I was not), it was not a good feeling to be under the scrutiny of the tax authorities here. However, all it took was a friendly thirty minute phone call to resolve what they termed a ‘discrepancy’. Be nice to the IRD, it will pay you back in spades. I personally like contracting because of the personal freedom. If you’re just not feeling it and it doesn’t affect your work, most places are happy for you to take time off or knock off early (after all, they’re not paying for it!). I find this helps keep the work/life balance, well, balanced.","metadata":{"namespace":"hnry.co.nz_theleap","filename":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_how-i-took-the-leap-3-contracting-pros-and-cons_.txt","link":"https://hnry.co.nz/theleap/how-i-took-the-leap-3-contracting-pros-and-cons/.txt","id":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_how-i-took-the-leap-3-contracting-pros-and-cons__1"}}],["42",{"pageContent":"Gabriella Morton is a freelance photographer based in Tāmaki Makaurau.

I’m a multidisciplinary creative aiming to bridge the gap between art and important messages like science/psychology/environment… Ultimately, this is to create a stronger narrative around sustainability. Facts need storytellers to breathe life into them and somebody needs to give them some soul. I enjoy sourcing hard to digest concepts and reformatting them creatively through photo and video so that visual learners can understand. Guilt, negativity and shame seem to have suffocated the sustainability space so I aim to shift that by first acting from a place of love and not fear. I use my fascination with our natural world to capture thought-provoking imagery because when people surrender to this powerful form of insignificance it helps them see the planet as a whole. Although I don’t strive to encourage consumerism, I am a strong believer that we need to use our dollar as a vote towards what kind of world we want to live in. When possible I use that privilege to carefully choose clients that align with this model. How long have you been self-employed and how did you start? Growing up with family in the film industry cameras have always been a massive part of my life. I was never a fan of being in front of the camera so I quickly discovered asking technical questions was the ideal excuse to get behind it. Over my teenage years I tried a lot of experimental photography using friends as models, and with the rise of social platforms like Tumblr and then Instagram sharing was more accessible than ever. Fresh out of Media Design School at age 18, I landed an inhouse digital marketing job creating content for consumer electronics.

I remember the commute alone could be up to 2-3 hours of traffic jam per day, I would always return home exhausted and uninspired to create anything of my own. Most of my ideas at work would be diluted to frame a different audience. I found a few side-hustles to keep my brain ticking, like offering event photography, setting up a print store and at one point I even started a jewellery business. But it wasn’t until 2014 that I really got hooked on my visual craft. As an escape from my dull 9-5 I started going camping every weekend, exploring a new part of the coastline each trip. It was here I fell in love with adventure and astrophotography. After a year abroad I figured I could work with tourism companies to create outdoor marketing material rather than returning to the cubicle. What is it like being self-employed? Full-time freelance photography clients didn’t come overnight. I had a safety net of savings to help me ease into it as well as offering freelance Web Design services to fill in the gaps. Although there were months in the beginning with little financial return, the power I had over my hours was a satisfactory reward. A lifestyle coated in the freedom that I would struggle to give up now that I’ve had a taste. They say it takes 3 years to build a business and I can honestly say that was accurate in my case as I enter my 4th year finally feeling a sense of comfort. Are there any unique experiences you’ve been through in or out of being self-employed you’d like to share? Project Blue? Being the boss of my own schedule has improved my quality of life immensely. Being able to say ‘Yes’ to passion projects I otherwise couldn’t justify the time for has got to be my favourite perk. The power of social networking and collaboration with fellow creatives has made me life long friends which also often eventuate into work opportunities. For example, because of my timetable flexibility, I had the opportunity to join the Project Blue crew.

In a world full of so many critical issues it all becomes a bit overwhelming. We started with protecting what we collectively have in common - the ocean. We’re now an organisation made up of 25 young Kiwi environmentalists (divers, marine biologists, surfers, lawyers and filmmakers) documenting where New Zealand’s plastic waste and recycling ends up. Through the art of filmmaking, we have spent the last 2 years compiling a feature-length documentary (across Aotearoa, Hawaii and Malaysia) on how to turn off single-use plastic at the source. While working alongside companies to improve where they can remove and reduce unnecessary single-use items we aim to inspire the youth through grassroots to tackle a mission of their own. What have been some outstanding challenges? A challenge I never thought I would face is separating my work/life balance. For years I tried to bring work into my personal space to make a living off what I enjoyed. That seemed logical until my obsession with productivity had me turning every holiday into a work trip and resulting in burnout. I learnt to set myself business hours (which can of course still be tailored to suit and shift) as well as using offline48 as a way to look forward to weekends and return to my emails excited for the projects to come. Having an office and bedroom combined has also proved to be unideal. Hours spent editing in the same place you go to unwind creates a blurred line and disassociation with the ability to switch off. My goal for 2021 is to set up a refreshing and inviting shared studio space that brings the excitement back to the drawing board. What’s the hardest thing about being self-employed? Something that is consistently hard about being self-employed is the short term contracts. Although the variety of clients keeps you on your toes it can be exhausting to be constantly pitching jobs before you’ve finished another. This realization helped me leap away from fast-paced content and dream big. Earning and learning the value of my skill set encourages me to say no to brands who don’t align which simultaneously creates space for my niche. Only having yourself to bounce ideas off, and ultimately report back to, can induce a mad case of imposter syndrome.

How has Hnry helped you being self-employed? I never learnt taxes in school so Hnry has completely eliminated my fear around self-employment. It enables me to work from anywhere and never think about tax again. When I discovered the app I could stop putting pressure on myself and allow the automated accounting software to calculate, deduct and file all my financial admin for me. The seamless quote and invoicing feature allows my clients to pay deposits as well as accepting credit card payments. Hnry keep tabs, shows me real insights and even chases up overdue invoices so I don’t personally have to nag. My favourite feature is uploading pictures of receipts from business expenses (instead of keeping them for eternity in the classic shoebox) and the software does the rest to ensure automatic tax relief. After 3 years as a loyal customer, I owe the freedom of my career to the lovely team at Hnry. Working remotely without the traditional stacks of paperwork really puts the glam back into self-employment! What advice would you give to someone just starting out? Initially, passion is such a puzzle. Most people know it when they see it but have a hard time creating it for themselves. It is however infectious, so surround yourself with the like-minded, network and collaborate with creatives who can help break down and tell your story. Attend events in your community to meet new people, publicly support your friend’s businesses to help them grow too, join Facebook groups and job directories, save inspiration and categorize them into mood boards you can reference at a later date, jot down ideas as notes on your phone and make lists with quantifiable tasks that you can physically tick off!

Someone posts a job, and freelancers put in their proposals and bids. More often than not, the client takes one of the very lowest bids, and that’s the end of the story for everyone else. In 2017, Erin Harrison recognised that this model was not really working for anyone. Freelancers were having to put in lots of bids at rock bottom prices just to compete, and they were getting very little back in return. Business owners didn’t have any way of vetting a freelancer’s skills and experience, and could easily end up getting burned by hiring someone who wasn’t up to the job. The only winner in this game was the platform, which took a portion of every freelancer’s invoices. So she made an alternative: The Freelance Village. The Freelance Village is a not-for-profit community that does three things: Gives businesses a central point to find professional, vetted freelancers. Gives freelancers a place to find new clients. Creates a community for freelancers. Fast forward to 2020, and Freelance Village has dozens of freelancers, with around 1,000 visitors to the website a month. It’s building a community and keeping its freelancers busy. The big differences There are a few key differences between The Freelance Village and other platforms that connect freelancers and clients. The first is that The Freelance Village is not a business. It’s a not-for-profit. Freelancers contribute a nominal amount for advertising and web hosting, but the focus is on community, rather than profit. Next, every freelancer is personally vetted by Erin to make sure they have what it takes to do good work for their clients. At the same time, the total number of freelancers in any given area of expertise is capped. This means that potential clients get just a few, highly skilled freelancers to choose from, rather than a huge pool of freelancers of all kinds of skill levels. The next difference is that The Freelance Village flips the traditional “post a job and get bids” process on its head. When people want to engage a freelancer from The Freelance Village, they just take a look at the small group of freelancers on the website. They then make direct contact with the freelancers they want to work with.

They then make direct contact with the freelancers they want to work with. This means that clients can choose freelancers who suit the problem they’re trying to solve, without having to sift through a bunch of unqualified applicants. Freelancers don’t have to compete with a whole bunch of other people for the same job - so there’s no race to the bottom. A road to success The effect of all this is to create a steady stream of work for freelancers on the platform. Cheyney McDonnell, a graphic designer and illustrator told me that her biggest client came to her through The Freelance Village in 2017 - and is still with her in 2020! Abby Beswick, a communications specialist (and Hnry user!) said something similar - “two of my best clients are from The Freelance Village.” This isn’t just from being on the website. Erin actively works to keep traffic coming to the website, so there’s lots of potential clients looking for freelancers. She invests in advertising, and the site gets around 1,000 views per month. Any one freelancer doesn’t have to capture much of that to stay busy! There have also been lots of opportunities for collaboration (more on that in a bit). One great example was that a number of freelancers were involved with the Mentemia app when it launched during the Covid-19 lockdowns in early 2020. A community When you go out on your own as a freelancer, you give up two things. The first is a steady income. The second is a community of like minded people. It’s easy to forget to take this second aspect into account when you go out on your own. But there really is something nice about spending time with people who are working on similar things to you, and generally moving in the same direction. When you go out freelancing, you give this up in favour of working on your own. Even if you work from a shared space, you don’t really get that same feeling of pulling in the same direction that you get when you work in a regular job. The Freelance Village sets out to provide some of the community you miss out on when you work on your own.

Freelancers from the Village also meet up in real life - they’ve met up for drinks in Auckland, and when I spoke to Cheyney McDonnell, she was about to go out for a walk with a friend she’d made at this meetup, several months before! So The Freelance Village isn’t just providing a source of work for freelancers - it’s giving them access to a community of people in similar situations, with similar challenges. A sum of more than its parts But the real value of The Freelance Village comes from combining the community with the steady stream of work. Freelance PR and Marketing consultant Angela March told me that she’s had situations where someone else in the community has been unable to take an incoming job because they’re at capacity. That community member passed the job onto her. Other freelancers I spoke to all told me similar stories: they had all passed work on to other freelancers, or had work passed on to them. It was a common thread. This has a few different effects: The referred freelancer gets a new piece of work. The client doesn’t have to keep looking. The too-busy freelancer still gets to provide some value, even though they can’t take the job But there’s a fourth effect across all of these: the reputation of the community improves. Every time this happens, The Freelance Village develops a better reputation as a place businesses can visit to get their job done, by a skilled freelancer. This in turn makes them more likely to use the community and recommend it, which makes the reputation even stronger. And at the same time, the relationship between the two freelancers referring jobs to one another becomes just a little bit stronger. And that relationship - and relationships like it - are what create the value in The Freelance Village in the first place. It’s a virtuous cycle. And it’s one that every freelancer I spoke to was quick to mention - work doesn’t just come in from the site itself, it comes from the community as well. Collaboration Then there’s one last effect: the opportunities for collaboration. As the community grows, each freelancer gets to know the other freelancers a bit better.

In New Zealand alone, nearly 34% of households are rented. That’s around 604,000 rentals in total. Where there’s demand there’s also an opportunity, and many New Zealanders are jumping at the chance to leverage real estate investments to achieve their financial goals. However, running a rental property (much like running any small business), comes with a number of time-consuming admin tasks. You need to track your income and expenses for tax purposes, and manage the day to day running of the property, such as managing listings and maintenance requests. The right software in this scenario can be both a life-saver and a serious asset to those searching for fiscal independence. We sat down with Logan Ransley, co-founder of Landlord Studio property management software, to talk about how the right software is a vital part of time management for those seeking financial freedom through self-employment and investments. What’s the idea behind Landlord Studio? How did it get started? Landlord Studio is all about supplying the tools a landlord needs to properly manage their investments and their time. It’s a mobile-first property management software, the first iteration of which was released back in 2016. Charles (our CEO) was looking for software to manage his own properties, but nothing he found fit his needs. So he built his own solution. That first version was called Property Buddy. It was launched in the app store and quickly gained organic traction in the market. In 2018 he took the leap to become self-employed and launched the current version of the software - Landlord Studio. Landlord Studio is aimed largely at the US property market, which has some 20 million units managed by independent landlords – but we have many landlords based in New Zealand as well. How is the New Zealand property market different to the US one? Fundamentally there is a difference in mindset. In the US, real estate is a key part of many people’s plans for achieving their monetary goals. The idea of leveraging real estate to build wealth is something that, for a growing number of people, is an achievable reality. In New Zealand, there are plenty of people that own baches. However, for most of the year, those baches just sit there costing the homeowner money. These properties could very easily be put to work to cover running costs, mortgages, and even create extra income.","metadata":{"namespace":"hnry.co.nz_theleap","filename":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_landlord-studio-and-rental-property-investments_.txt","link":"https://hnry.co.nz/theleap/landlord-studio-and-rental-property-investments/.txt","id":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_landlord-studio-and-rental-property-investments__0"}}],["51",{"pageContent":"are plenty of people that own baches. However, for most of the year, those baches just sit there costing the homeowner money. These properties could very easily be put to work to cover running costs, mortgages, and even create extra income. A lot of New Zealanders are thinking about legacy rather than creating rental income today. The idea of renting their second home often isn’t even considered. That being said, we recently partnered with ASB and ran a promotion to their customers and we had hundreds of Kiwi landlords jump on board, looking for more efficient ways to self-manage their rentals. This just goes to show that there are plenty of Kiwis who have already recognised the opportunity that real estate presents. Can you talk a bit more about “leveraging” real estate to achieve financial freedom? Real estate should form part of everyone’s investment portfolio. The main problem is that it comes with such a high monetary entry barrier. The beauty of rental properties though, is that the income they produce goes towards paying off the debt you assumed when you purchased it - you build capital in an appreciable asset whilst simultaneously earning income. This is what investors call good debt, debt that works for you as opposed to against you. That first property is always the hardest, but you don’t need to be a multi-millionaire to step into the real estate investing game. The right property in the right location could be very affordable, and generate impressive returns. It’s all about locating the best opportunities. There are difficulties and risks as with any investment, such as bad tenants or unexpected maintenance requests, but a properly managed real estate investment can be an incredibly lucrative side gig - with pretty minimal time input and management stress (especially with the right software in your pocket). What effective real estate strategies have you seen your customers implementing? Some of the most successful landlords on our system have developed very succinct processes that work for them. These processes allow them to continuously build and expand their portfolios, going from 1 to as many as 20 investment properties in a matter of years. We have one customer, for example, based in the UK, who has worked his way up to 15 properties in the space of 5 years without investing any of his own money. He has used private loans and cleverly refinanced his current assets to create low-interest debt that more than pays for itself.

He has used private loans and cleverly refinanced his current assets to create low-interest debt that more than pays for itself. He is now in his 40’s, and both his wife and himself have quit their day jobs and manage their property portfolio - pretty much - from the comfort of a beach lounger in Spain. He’s able to do this because he’s worked out a system, built a reliable team, and of course, utilises technology to automate tasks and effectively stay on top of his income, expenses and communications. What advice can you give people looking to move into real estate investing? The first tip we’d share is to read everything you can about real estate investing. You need to be familiar with all the laws and regulations that come with being a landlord, and be able to identify best practices when it comes to managing tenants and dealing with maintenance issues. Educating yourself is the only way you can ensure you stay compliant with the law, and avoid potentially costly mistakes which could bring your career as a landlord to an abrupt end. Our second tip is all about time management. This is why software like Hnry, and Landlord Studio exist. The old adage ‘time is money’ has never been truer and there is now a multiplicity of ways that entrepreneurs can buy back their time using these intuitive and innovative softwares. Our final tip is to form an investment strategy that suits you. Make sure you know what your end goals are. Do you want to invest in a property that will generate positive cash flow ongoing? Are you going to fix and flip? Or is it a speculative investment aiming to capitalise on capital gains? Knowing what your goals are will help you analyse potential investments and decide which deals are worth fighting for or walking away from.","metadata":{"namespace":"hnry.co.nz_theleap","filename":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_landlord-studio-and-rental-property-investments_.txt","link":"https://hnry.co.nz/theleap/landlord-studio-and-rental-property-investments/.txt","id":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_landlord-studio-and-rental-property-investments__2"}}],["53",{"pageContent":"Mary Holm is a column writer for the Weekend Herald, the bestselling author of several finance books, and an educator on personal finance, savings, and investments.

What is a healthy work/life balance? What is the best approach to investing? You can order a discounted copy of Mary’s book on her website, and be sure to check out her writing in the New Zealand Herald for regular tips on investing and finance. How did you start out writing about finance? I’ve been in journalism my whole career. I got my MA in journalism in Michigan, moved to Chicago, and then worked for several papers in Chicago. And along the way there, I found that there were more openings in the business side of journalism because a lot of reporters aren’t good at numbers. That was a way of getting a job on smaller papers, but then, later on, it was a way of shifting from editing to reporting on the bigger Chicago papers. But I’m not a person who spends my leisure time reading finance stuff. People ask me if I’ve read the latest finance books, and I tell them I’m too busy reading novels! I’m not hellbent on money being the main thing in life. I hadn’t actually written any books for ten years until Rich Enough. I’d given up on books mainly because it can be quite hard to publish a book in New Zealand that makes much money. It’s perhaps too small a country and the sales just aren’t that big. So for all the work you put in, you don’t usually get a lot back for it. Books are just quite nice to have alongside journalism. What was it about this particular book that brought you back? A publisher approached me from Harper Collins and asked how I felt about writing another book. I told them that I’d given up on writing books, but we got talking and I said that in some ways, I’m more interested in the relationship between money and happiness than I am about maximising how much money someone has. So we talked more and decided to make that the point of my next book. The framework of the book is about getting rich enough to do the things that really matter in life, things that aren’t necessarily to do with money.

The framework of the book is about getting rich enough to do the things that really matter in life, things that aren’t necessarily to do with money. I start out by saying, ‘Hey, reader: let’s get you rich enough so that you can then get on with the other more important things in life.’ A lot of research shows that if you haven’t got enough money to live reasonably and comfortably – to put shoes on the feet of your children – then of course, getting more money makes you happier. There’s no disputing that. But a lot of research suggests that once you get to a certain point of wealth and income, then having more money doesn’t necessarily make you happier. While I was thinking about this, my son came across some newer research which shows that, in fact, richer people tend to be less happy. And one global study, in which they interviewed thousands of people (some in New Zealand), showed that it’s not so much about getting a pay rise or, if you’re a freelancer, a new contract, that will make people happier in the long-run. When they looked at people with a higher level of wealth, they asked two questions to measure happiness: On a ladder with ten steps on it – the bottom step having a really horrible life and the top step having the happiest life possible – which rung are you on? Yesterday, what was the dominant emotion you felt? They gave people a list of emotions to choose from: joy, elation, sadness, boredom, etc. From those two measures, they worked out who was happier, and they found out that richer people, past a certain point, were less happy than those in the middle. And then they postulated that it’s probably because richer people can get absorbed with earning more money, having more acquisitions, and wondering where and how to invest. People can tend to get more ‘status-conscious’ – that they haven’t got as good a car as their neighbour, for example – and so they’re just not as happy. The basic idea of the book is to focus on getting yourself rich enough so that you can get on with the things that really make you happy.

The bulk of the book is centred around eight steps that can get you to a point where you’re rich enough to get on with other things in your life. Can you talk a bit about the title? How do you define ‘richness’? It’s a terribly old cliche, the saying that nobody on their deathbed says they wish they’d spent more time at the office. But it’s still a really good thing to keep in mind, especially for self-employed people. I’m one myself – I’ve been self-employed now for over twenty years and I think, on the one hand, it’s neat because I can quite often be flexible with my time. If there’s a friend or family who needs some support, we can quite often go off in the middle of the day and give it to them. On the other hand, though, a lot of self-employed people, myself included sometimes, can take on too much work when it’s offered because they’re scared that six months down the track they might not have enough. So sometimes, self-employed people can end up working awfully hard and not really have weekends free. So it’s a bit of a mix for self-employed people. People are making a bigger point of having a clear work/life balance. What does it mean for someone to have an enriched life in the current moment? I do think that cell phones are a blessing and a curse, because we tend to be constantly thinking about checking our emails or texts. There’s always that fear that we might be missing out on something. I’m actually quite shocked when I work on my column, which I sometimes do on the weekend (as many other self-employed people do). I’ll send off a question for my column to the IRD on a Sunday afternoon and I totally don’t expect a reply until Monday morning. But then half an hour later I get a reply from someone who works at the government. I think that’s not good – someone is monitoring their emails on a Sunday afternoon. On the other hand, in many workplaces, you hear Chief Executives being concerned with people’s lives outside of work. That’s a very different attitude to when I was in the workforce in the 80s and 90s.

That’s a very different attitude to when I was in the workforce in the 80s and 90s. There’s more acknowledgement, for example, that if someone has a sick child, they might have to take some time off work. What do you think has brought about that shift in attitude? I think there’s a realisation from employers that if they don’t treat people well and realise that they have lives outside of work, giving them some flexibility, then they’re not going to be able to keep good people. If they get a reputation for having a workplace that cares about people’s welfare, then they’re more likely to attract good people. Compared to twenty years ago, there’s a lot more flexibility in terms of when and where you work. That idea of ‘where’ has changed dramatically, with people being able to work from anywhere as long as there’s an internet connection. And while that’s attractive to people, there’s just the risk that we are always sort of half ‘switched-on’ with our work, that we’re always accessible. It is quite hard to turn everything off. How can self-employed people achieve that richness? Are there any misconceptions around richness? I like to think that a lot of self-employed people are doing the sort of work they love to do. People in the creative arts, I assume, love to be creative. But even in other areas, it’s surprising what people love to do. You get people who love being accountants. I love writing, and so there are times when I’m sitting here writing my Herald column and I’m actually really enjoying it. So, stopping to go for a walk or a swim isn’t necessarily going from something horrible to something wonderful, it’s just going from different sorts of nice stuff. I do worry that some people don’t get to do what they love doing enough. They’re always feeling like they should do this, or should do that. I think I’m getting a bit better at that, myself. When you’re self-employed, there’s always something you could be doing for work. The weekend comes around, and you could spend Saturday doing a bit more or doing something a bit better, so the work can be kind of endless. You could end up spending a lot of your waking hours on the business.

You could end up spending a lot of your waking hours on the business. It takes a lot to go: “I’m not being forced away from my work today, I’m choosing to go away from my work today.” And it usually works out. Somehow or another you end up getting enough work done, and well enough, to keep going. How do you think individuals can get that feeling of richness throughout life? It’s about achieving that feeling of knowing that the money is sorted. It’s not that you can buy everything all the time, but that it’s not terrible if the car breaks down and it can be quite expensive to repair it. I think that’s one definition of being ‘rich enough’: that when something goes wrong, it’s not a crisis to fix. It can still be awful when something goes wrong, and little and big bad things happen all the time. You want a bit of money to cope with the little crises that happen in life. And also to be able to go to the movies, and have a cheap and cheerful meal, without that breaking the bank. You often write about KiwiSaver for the self-employed – can you share your insights on that? Broadly speaking, the self-employed are underrepresented in KiwiSaver. The data is starting to show that about 30% of people who are not in fixed employment are making KiwiSaver contributions, whereas 75% of employees are. The government contribution is still a good deal for the self-employed, because your money is multiplied by one and a half. If you put in $1043, the government puts in $521. So, just broadly speaking, I often tell people, “instead of retiring with, say, $100,000 in savings, you’ll have $150,000. So it’s that simple, and that’s a huge difference, and a lot of people haven’t got that message yet. How can the self-employed take advantage of KiwiSaver? Getting the government contribution is the best start. To get that $1043 in there, it’s much easier for people to put in $87 a month, or $20 a week, than finding $1043 once a year.

Quite a few self-employed people that I speak to often think that they can do better with their investing elsewhere. They’re perhaps more inclined to be independent investors: they pick which shares to buy or they own a rental property, rather than just having money in the bank or having money in KiwiSaver. You actually probably can’t do better than KiwiSaver – not when you take risk into account. The extra money that’s coming in from the government gives KiwiSaver a kind of unfair advantage, compared to other kinds of investments. In the whole economy, the riskier the investment, the higher the average return. But with KiwiSaver, they’ve kind of bumped that equation up one level, and so people do better in KiwiSaver than in an alternative, because of the risks involved in the latter option. What is that best mix of investments for the self-employed? If you are making long-term retirement savings, then it’s best to go into a KiwiSaver growth fund. For money that you’re not saving for retirement, where it might be best to be able to access the money earlier, then I’d say get into a non-KiwiSaver fund. There’s a whole other group of funds out there that are pretty much the same as KiwiSaver funds. Some KiwiSaver providers might offer high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk funds in KiwiSaver, and then very similar funds that are outside KiwiSaver. The main difference is that with non-KiwiSaver funds, you can get your money out whenever you want to. The fees often end up being a little bit higher, in the non-KiwiSaver ones, because that access is there. The broad rule with savings is: if you’re planning to spend the money in ten years or more, go into a higher risk growth type fund. if you’re planning to spend your savings within three years, it’s best to go with a bank term deposit.

There’s too big a chance that if you put it into something riskier, the market might go down right before you want to take your money out – as some people have seen lately. In the long-term, the market will go up and down sometimes, but there’s time for it to recover. And for that middle-level money, money that you plan to spend between three and ten years, it’s a pretty good idea to go into a medium-risk, balanced fund, inside or outside of KiwiSaver. Then, once you get within three years of spending it, move it into either a very low-risk fund or a bank term deposit. One really important thing to remember, if you are in the higher risk funds, especially in the growth funds for the longer term, you’ve got to promise yourself that you won’t panic and move the money out when the markets go down. In those higher-risk funds, especially in the last few decades, there have been times when people’s money was halved. They have $10,000 and then over the course of the week their money can drop to $5,000. That has happened in history, and we’ve had a slightly less dramatic example of it in March this year. A lot of people see that happen and go, “oh my god, I can’t cope with this,” and they move their money at that point to something lower risk, and that’s a terrible thing to do. They’ve made their losses real. They would have been far better off to have stayed in a lower risk fund all along. Is that because the losses in a higher-risk fund are, at least initially, more severe? Well, you just won’t make that kind of loss in a lower risk fund. It’ll grow more slowly but it won’t go down nearly as much. If you look at what some people have done lately, they would have been better off being in a low-risk fund all along, than being in a higher-risk one and then panicking when the markets went down. The markets always go back up again, though sometimes they can take a few years to do so. You’ve really got to promise yourself that you won’t panic.

I always say to people: imagine that your current balance gets halved in a short amount of time, and just picture what you’d do. What kinds of trends are you seeing when it comes to how people are managing their savings and investment plans? One of the interesting trends I’m seeing is this idea called “FIRE” (Financially Independent, Retire Early). These people are extreme savers – watching every penny they spend – with this goal to retire at 40. And I wonder how it will work, because they’ll swing from being very frugal about how they spend their time and their money, to suddenly having all of the time in the world and a fair bit of money. I’ve had a couple of letters to my Herald column recently, about people who were frugal when they were younger, often because they had to be, and now that they’re retired and they’ve got the money, they don’t know how to relax that frugality and enjoy their money. People get used to living a certain way, not that that’s a terrible thing, but there is a worry that you’re forgoing too much of your life in the meantime. For example, if you’ve got little kids and you’re working really hard and not spending much time with them, you don’t get that back when the kids are older. Suddenly you’ve got more time and you’d like to spend more time with them but you might not have as close a bond with them because you were working too hard when they were little. You can read about it online, people who are struggling to save for a house. It’s damn hard at the moment, especially if you’re in a big city and house prices are ridiculous, and so I’m saying to people: “look, don’t feel like you have to own a home in order to have your financial act together. If you don’t have a home, save really hard in order to have a big lump sum in retirement to cover your accommodation from then on.” If you’re thinking that way, then somewhere along the way house prices might go down and people might be able to afford to buy. It actually looks as if prices will fall in the months to come, but maybe not enough. Who knows? At the moment, the house price to income ratio is eight or nine times average income and historically it’s about three times.

I guess what I’m saying to people is that you don’t have to get into this whole FIRE thing, and I think it’s maybe a bit silly to get into it too much. But if you’re looking for ways to save and be careful about your money so that you can put a house deposit together, you might want to read a bit about what different people do to cut their spending. Having a spending/saving balance is just as important as having a work/life balance. A lot of people are too much one way or too much the other. What’s the best approach to investing? Set and forget, or more hands-on? I’m an advocate of set and forget. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have a look every year or two at where things are going, and be aware of them. But things like choosing which shares to buy and sell, choosing when to get in and out of the market, or choosing which rental properties to buy and sell – a lot of research suggests that those people who get into that actually do worse than the ones who get into the right level of KiwiSaver and just leave it there. Is that because the set and forget approach is less stress-inducing? It’s not really about stress. Some people find the hands-on approach fun and not stressful. It’s exciting for some, it’s a game. If you’re well-off enough and you enjoy it, then why not? But a lot of research, and I’ve quoted some numbers in the book, shows that people who are in and out of the markets, on average, do quite a lot worse than people who just put their money in and then leave it there. So it’s one of those unusual things in life when doing less is actually better. In most other skills, the more you practice and learn about them, the better you do. But that isn’t true in investing. The idea with my book is that people can read it, get things set up, and then get on with the other, much more important things in life – like friends and family.","metadata":{"namespace":"hnry.co.nz_theleap","filename":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_mary-holm-shares-self-employed-investment-tips_.txt","link":"https://hnry.co.nz/theleap/mary-holm-shares-self-employed-investment-tips/.txt","id":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_mary-holm-shares-self-employed-investment-tips__8"}}],["62",{"pageContent":"It’s hard being self-employed. There’s a lot to think about, and a lot of responsibilities on your shoulders. For most self-employed people, it can be hard to keep on top of the admin burden, not to mention being able to maintain a consistent income. Part of the issue is that the systems and processes in place for self-employed people tend to punish, rather than encourage self-employment. When you’re self-employed it can be hard to get a mortgage, hard to get a loan and getting insurance can be a frustrating process. Governments and banks haven’t updated their thinking about self-employment for over 50 years now. Everything requires deep levels of input or understanding, and as a self-employed person you’re expected to know all your tax and compliance responsibilities from day one. Here at Hnry, we’ve recently performed a lot of in-depth research, speaking to a large number of self-employed people about the sorts of challenges they face. Here are the challenges that came up consistently: Faced with all these challenges, most self-employed individuals used to default to employing the services of an Accountant or Bookkeeper… What things do Accountants or Bookkeepers tend to do? In general, they will work out what you need to pay for Income Tax and GST, and tell you when to pay it. They’ll help you by filing your Income Tax and GST returns, although there will still be a fair amount of time required from you. On the whole, accountants don’t tend to handle anything to do with ACC/Medicare, so all of the calculations and payments to ACC/Medicare will fall to you. The main value of having an accountant is the potential opportunity to learn about what your tax and compliance responsibilities are, and to get access to some financial advice (it’s worth noting that some accountants are not comfortable or aren’t permitted to provide financial advice though). Here’s that table again, with the things that most accountants or bookkeepers help with highlighted in grey: What things can Accounting Software do? In the last few years, the Accounting Software market has really come into it’s own.

But as more people join the ranks of the freelance economy, shared spaces that provide that necessary framework and sense of community are becoming more common. The world of freelancing is more wide open than it’s ever been and coworking spaces are there to help you gain momentum. Why A Coworking Space? More and more people are discovering the joys of a flexible work schedule: clients you can choose and the freedom of moving from contract to contract. Coworking spaces, those places in which freelancers, entrepreneurs, small businesses, startups, and sole traders can gather with no corporate umbrella to dictate how they allocate their time, are on the rise. In Wellington alone there are a handful of spaces specifically designed for freelancers; spaces where you can work (for yourself, of course) alongside other like-minded individuals and share creative ideas and methodologies. Most coworking spaces are set up for individuals and small businesses, though some even cater to more mid-sized startups. For those wanting to leave their “work-from-home” situation for a more structured environment, a coworking space is the perfect next step: designed for your needs, affordable, and ripe with inspiration. Because coworking spaces are so full of varying businesses and creative ideas, often times you’ll receive motivation of some kind, and support, from the people who work in close proximity to you. As opposed to working from home, coworking spaces offer a vast array of resources that can help you solve challenging problems, build your network, and grow your business. So What Do Coworking Spaces Offer? Most coworking spaces provide individuals with all of the necessary workplace requisites: a desk and chair, wifi, a printer/scanner, coffee and tea. Some, however, offer some really cool features to make your workspace that much more unique. Movers & Shakers, located in the Britomart area of Auckland, has a “30ft inflatable braincell” where people can work; Petridish, a shared office space in Dunedin, features murals painted by local artists. Most coworking spaces understand the need to build a community of people who share common values.

Most coworking spaces understand the need to build a community of people who share common values. So these spaces will organise training events and talks geared towards the future of work, the nature of freelancing and contracting, and other innovative topics. With the increasing popularity of coworking spaces, we’re also starting to see larger companies collaborate with these spaces in order to build an even more diverse community through public forums and workshops. Some coworking spaces look like the inside of the bedroom from 2001: A Space Odyssey, while some offer a more rustic feel with fine wood finishes and exposed brick. Some coworking spaces are loose, warm networking hubs (such as Exchange in Christchurch), while others offer business development programmes, such as Ministry of Awesome (also in Christchurch). Some coworking spaces are also attached to accelerator and investment programmes (The Ice House), so that you can get sound business advice for your creative ideas. These coworking spaces allow you to grow your startup or entrepreneurial business as you wish. How Much Do They Cost? Of course, the pricing models of these coworking spaces vary greatly. Depending on the type of coworking space (eg, what services and amenities it provides, and how futuristic the interior looks), you can be paying as little as $20 a month or as much as $500 a month (prices not including GST). Some coworking spaces even offer free trials so that you can get a feel for the place, before you even spend a cent. If you’re brand new to the idea of a coworking space, it can be hard to determine what a good space might entail. Depending on your needs (and budget), you might be wondering what the right place is. We recommend doing a bit of research about what’s in your area and checking out what each coworking space offers. The must-haves for a good coworking space include: High-Speed Internet: this almost goes without saying, but you can’t do much without Internet. No one wants to work in a space that has a poor connection; it will frustrate you and that isn’t good for workflow. Location: how far from home is too far? If you’re giving up the “work-from-home lifestyle” you won’t want to have to travel across town to work in a space that might end up costing $200/month.

It’d be a pain to get locked out of your coworking space once the clock hits five. Events/Community: given the steep pricetag for some of these coworking spaces, you want to feel like you’re getting some extra perks with your monthly payments. Most spaces offer after work events, but some also offer guest speakers, workshops, and seminars. An important thing to keep in mind is that, in this case, cheap doesn’t always mean better. At a lot of these coworking spaces, you often get what you pay for. As the freelance economy takes flight, expect to see more coworking spaces pop up all around the country and beyond.

With over 500 regular donors, the Wellington-based nonprofit is about to hit the $1M milestone for money raised for Kiwi charities, ranging from Kaibosh to Sustainable Coastlines (to name just a few). We chatted to founder and Chief Doer of Things, Pat Shepherd, about setting up One Percent Collective and how he sees the “giving landscape” changing in the coming years. What was the original idea behind One Percent Collective and how are you engaging more people to make charitable donations? The original idea was to simplify the way we give to causes we care about. Rather than making one-off donations now and then, we wanted to inspire people to give on the regular, so that small charities can really plan ahead better, thus being able to have more impact on the areas they are working on. We were also seeing our friends not enjoying the fundraising methods many of the larger charities use so we wanted to create a different model, with storytelling, events, and a real human approach to giving being at the heart of everything we do. How is One Percent Collective making it easier for people to make charitable donations? First up we focused on the user experience, so we designed our setup process to take around 3 minutes. The donor is always in control of how much, how often, and which of our partner charities they share their donations with. Then we looked at how to share the great news from our organisations through storytelling and events. At the end of each year, we simplified things with one annual summary donation receipt, rather than bits of paper each month that just get lost. All of this makes life easier for our donors, our charities, and us. Many self-employed people don’t often consider making charitable donations. Permanent staff have the option of Payroll Giving, but there isn’t really an equivalent for the self-employed. Is this something you’ve seen change over time? In New Zealand, Payroll Giving still hasn’t really taken off: only around 1% of our donors give via Payroll Giving. We have had a number of self-employed people who want to give their 1% but with fluctuating income, they have found it hard to commit. We work with them by saying “tell us your charities, pop our info into your online banking and anytime you want to donate","metadata":{"namespace":"hnry.co.nz_theleap","filename":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_one-percent-collectives-pat-shepherd_.txt","link":"https://hnry.co.nz/theleap/one-percent-collectives-pat-shepherd/.txt","id":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_one-percent-collectives-pat-shepherd__0"}}],["70",{"pageContent":"self-employed people who want to give their 1% but with fluctuating income, they have found it hard to commit. We work with them by saying “tell us your charities, pop our info into your online banking and anytime you want to donate, just transfer the amount you want – we’ll take care of the rest”. This has made it much easier for people to give as and when they want to. There’s more info on this way of giving here. What role do technological changes and innovations (eg digital donations) play in enabling more people to give to charities? There are a number of ways to give and it’s only going to get bigger in terms of options, with crypto, Apple Pay, and others all being methods that will start to have an impact. I personally think no matter how many methods there are, the biggest challenge first off is to inspire people to take action. For us, regular giving really is key: this is how the charities can really plan their impact, so it’s what we’ve chosen to focus our attention on, plus with 98% of our donors giving via online banking, it shows that at present it’s the most popular way for us. What sorts of tax relief can self-employed people get when they make charitable donations? When you donate to a registered NZ charity with donee status, you can claim up to a third of your donation back at the end of the tax year. This is huge because if you donated $600 you would get $200 back. That way you can use it to treat yourself or give it back to charity. Way too many people forget to claim it which is crazy, as it just means it stays with the IRD instead. What’s the one thing you’d like to see change about the way that Kiwis plan around charitable giving? I really would love to see giving 1% as the norm for all those that can afford it. Many of us live very lucky lives and the least we can do is donate 1% of our income to help those that need our support. I often remind people that we still get to keep the other 99%, so 1% really is an easy way to plan your charitable giving. For the average Kiwi, it’s around $10 a week.

Imagine if every new hire was given an option to tick the box when they started so that they could simply give a % out of each paycheck. It keeps their life easy, they barely notice it and charities get to do what they do best which is to support the community. What sorts of trends are you seeing in New Zealand in regard to charitable giving? One of the biggest changes over the years is the ability to support friends or family going through tough times via crowdfunding. While this isn’t a donation to registered charities, I think it’s an important part of the giving landscape and something I ensure I do alongside my 1% to registered charities. More and more, I hear people working on apps for giving or ways to tag a charitable support method into their businesses. I think this is awesome and when done right can have an amazing impact.

It used to be the case that you were ‘either-or’: you were either a permanent employee, or you earned income independently. Nowadays, people are earning income concurrently across multiple different sources, both permanent and independent. The lines between what is permanent and freelance are blurring, and that means we need to evolve not only the way we think about work, but also the way we manage our work. Portfolioism is the Future In February this year, April Rinne wrote a fantastic article for Quartz, in which she described the career of the future being more like a portfolio than a set path. This idea of ‘portfolioism’ is becoming very commonplace in the world of independent earning. Rather than limiting yourself to one single source of income using one single skill, why not diversify your ‘earning portfolio’ across multiple sources of income and reduce the risk of putting all your eggs in one basket? This is already happening today: for instance, Project Managers that moonlight as Uber Drivers or Wedding Photographers at weekends. Whether knowingly or not, a large number of us are creating a ‘portfolio’ of work and we’re investing in those areas that bring us the greatest returns in overall well-being. These ‘returns’ may not necessarily be limited to purely financial returns either. For a large number of people, the ‘returns’ from working can also be environmental or social. For example you might earn a modest income from an area that brings you great personal satisfaction and joy, but that perhaps does not bring significant financial returns. Managing your Career Portfolio As we all start to become more comfortable with this idea of having a portfolio, so must we all become comfortable with the idea of managing our portfolio. Some of us may already be subconsciously doing this. However, I believe that there is a real need for us all to become more conscious of – and make more measured decisions regarding – the future of our portfolios.

In other words, if you notice your industry or skills are in decline then investing in alternative skillsets early is the best way to plan for your future) The key factors to consider when creating and managing your portfolio are: Portfolio Diversity Think about the different skills that are required across all of your income sources. Do you have the capacity and/or capability to be able to dedicate yourself to a widely diverse portfolio? It can be rewarding to have an extremely diverse portfolio but it can also force you to up-skill in many areas concurrently. Portfolio Risk What is the Risk Profile of your Portfolio? Just as investing in more volatile stocks or financial products yields more risk, there will be income streams that come with higher risk associations. The extent to which you take advantage of some of the more high risk/high reward income streams will depend on your overall risk appetite. There may be a chance that the value of a skill you’ve learned suddenly goes down in value or demand. You don’t want to be stuck having dedicated all your time to a skill or industry where the demand suddenly declines due to environmental or technological changes. It’s also worth noting that your risk appetite may alter over time: perhaps early on in your career you opt for a more high-risk strategy but as time goes on you become more conservative – especially at times when volatility in your income would have more of an impact on you. Portfolio Timeline & Goals Investments are all about looking to the future. Similarly for portfolioists, the decisions made on their earning portfolio will be driven by the timeframes they wish to invest over and the goals they are looking to achieve. Are you looking for ‘returns’ over the course of a year or even five? How about 10 years? Your timeframes will always dictate where and how you invest your time based on the potential rate of return. The ability to set clear goals for your portfolio early on – frequently re-assessing them – can help you to focus your efforts and invest in those areas that will help you achieve your goals. Portfolio Metrics Ask any seasoned investor and they’ll tell you that one of the most important parts of managing a portfolio is being able to read the data.

Finding a Balance As with any investment portfolio, your portfolio of work is all about finding a balance that works for you. You might be most comfortable at the conservative end of the spectrum, with a single earning source in an industry that is currently very stable. Conversely, you might be more comfortable at the opposite end of the scale, spreading your skillset across many higher-risk areas to increase your rate of return.

In this interview, Natalie shares with James some pricing strategies: methods for setting your price, maintaining a network of referrals, and ways we can achieve the goals we set for ourselves. Tell us a little bit about your business. How did you get into it? I work with women entrepreneurs, freelancers and business owners to help them sort out their pricing and understand their value, so they can pay themselves what they’re worth, without having to burn out in the process. I recently spent 10 years living in London doing business transform. In my final couple of years, I went contracting, and loved it. It was great to have the freedom and flexibility to be able to charge more on an hourly daily basis and have more control over how and with whom I worked. Then, a few years ago now, I decided to become a single mum by choice. I thought my life wasn’t challenging enough, so I became a mother and moved back to New Zealand to raise my daughter with my family here. When my daughter was around 12 months old, I was like, “right, okay, we have to make plans, get some money happening, and get back into work”. However when I looked at going back into the corporate world, and at Auckland’s three hour long commute, I thought to myself: “I didn’t give up my career and life in London to have a daughter and never see her.” So I changed the way I worked: rather than going into businesses and fixing things for them, I now teach entrepreneurs and business owners how to get their pricing sorted for themselves so they can run a profitable business. It’s fantastic and I love it. It’s the best thing I ever could have done. Let’s get into some common trends around pricing. Why do you think people find it so difficult to arrive at a number and put it out there to clients? I think there are a number of different reasons. For Kiwis, we have what’s called ‘tall poppy syndrome’. We’re taught to not put ourselves on a pedestal.

We’re taught to not put ourselves on a pedestal. In terms of how much we’re worth, we find it really difficult to go: “I’m really good at what I do, so I’m going to charge x amount of money.” That’s been beaten out of us for generations, and I think our culture makes it difficult for us to put an appropriate price tag on what we do. The US and Australia have slightly different mindsets around that issue. I think another thing is that we’re not taught how to put a price tag on our value. Where do you learn that skill? It’s not something you’re taught in school, it’s not something you’re taught in university. If you’ve been working in a corporate environment, you have very little access to how your boss figured out how to charge out your time. Then there’s this disconnect, you know, if you’ve been aware of what your hourly rate was, when you were working in employment, there’s this disconnect between how that was calculated, and what your worth is without the overheads and all the other things that go into factoring in that time. So I think for a lot of people starting out, there’s a confidence issue: on one side, not really knowing how to work out how much they’re worth; and on the other side there’s the practical side – how to price and how to work out how much you’re worth – that no one teaches you. Without any kind of pricing benchmark, it can be really easy for people to sell themselves short or completely overblow their rate. Where does pricing become a point of negotiation with a client? That’s a really relevant fear for why people price the way they do: because they don’t want either of those situations to happen. There are four key pricing methods that people can use to figure out how to price themselves out: The most common one is market-based pricing. Market-based pricing is where we look at what the market rate is, and then evaluate: are you more or less experienced? Can you afford to charge more or less than the market rate? That’s kind of been the standard within the freelance arena. The challenge with using the market-based pricing method alone, is that you don’t actually know if your competitors are making any money. You know, you don’t know if they’re making the salary that they need to in order to make the work viable","metadata":{"namespace":"hnry.co.nz_theleap","filename":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_pricing-expert-natalie-coombe_.txt","link":"https://hnry.co.nz/theleap/pricing-expert-natalie-coombe/.txt","id":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_pricing-expert-natalie-coombe__1"}}],["77",{"pageContent":"The challenge with using the market-based pricing method alone, is that you don’t actually know if your competitors are making any money. You know, you don’t know if they’re making the salary that they need to in order to make the work viable for them. And if they are, you don’t know what their personal expenses are going to be, how many hours they’re having to work, how many contracts they’re having to take. So these are all different variables that will influence how much they’re actually able to make. Out of the four, the two methods that are most powerful are a combination of cost-based pricing and value-based pricing. Cost-based pricing is where you work out the following factors in order to settle on what you need to be charging: how much you want to earn what your expenses are likely to be how you want to work That combined method is really powerful because it really focuses on you, as opposed to comparing yourself to somebody else. When you partner that with a value-based approach, which is where you focus not just on yourself, but on what you help someone else achieve and how valuable that is to them – that becomes a really powerful combination. How can a exceptional freelancer factor in their efficiency to their pricing? So with the value-based approach, a really exceptional freelancer can ask themselves: “what’s the minimum I need to charge for my time, in order for me to earn the minimum salary I’m happy earning, and only working the hours I have available? And how likely it is I’m going to get ongoing contracts?” So obviously, for freelancers, you don’t want to have to work every single day of the year in order to be able to pay your rent. The reality is that your contracts are going to come in fits and starts: you’re going to have peak seasons and you’re going to have low times, which your rate will need to take into consideration. That’s why a lot of people, when they start out freelancing, they go: “Oh, my salary was x so I’ll divide that by how many days per week that I’ll work, and that’s what I have to charge.” When I hear people say that I go, no, no, no, no, no no! Your salary was guaranteed, but now you have to factor in the fact that there might be at least three months of the year when you’re not earning.

Your salary was guaranteed, but now you have to factor in the fact that there might be at least three months of the year when you’re not earning. So you’ll need to earn all of your salary in only the time that you’re actually going to be on contract, which is why freelancers are so much more expensive per day than permanent employees, because they factor that uncertainty into their day rate. That’s an exercise that’s definitely worth doing, so that freelancers can understand the minimum they’d need to make. A really good freelancer will be able to achieve in one day what someone else might take two or three days to do. When you’re dealing with, say, design, if you can encapsulate and articulate the brand super quickly and add that level of quality, it means a client might say yes straight away. That is different to someone who hasn’t got as much experience or may not be pixel perfect, where it actually takes longer to get there. There might be more amends, more redos, because they haven’t quite nailed it the first time around. So there’s a massive difference and cost benefit for the client, where they might have to pay a little bit more for the person with more experience who gets it right, fast, the first time. So for freelancers that take a third of the time to complete a project, they could double their price and still be cost-saving. It’s such a noisy and competitive market out there. Without a referral, how can freelancers demonstrate their value when they’re just starting out with someone? A large part of what I used to do was be responsible for hiring contractors, particularly around digital advertising and marketing. If you get a referral – either from someone in your staff who has worked with that person somewhere else, or maybe you’ve worked with them before – you will take that freelancer with you, wherever you go. They’ll be your first port of call because they’re reliable: you know what to get from them, you know that you’ll get the kind of answer you need, nine times out of 10. As a freelancer, keeping in contact with people you’ve worked with before is an incredibly powerful way of both filling your freelance pipeline with work, but also filling it with work where you don’t have to justify your own worth. That’s number one: always make the most of your network.

That’s number one: always make the most of your network. Keep tapping into it and asking people how they’re getting on, just to keep in front of mind. That way, you’re the first person they think of when they’re looking for someone like you. The second thing is your portfolio. Having an up-to-date portfolio, particularly if you’re in design or coding – areas where you can display your work – having that is really important to ensure that your skills align with the needs of potential clients. When I was looking at working with a new freelancer, we’d ask for referrals but very rarely did we ever bother to follow them up. We just wanted to see that they had some. LinkedIn is great for this now: if you can get past employers or co-workers to write a referral for you on LinkedIn that talks about you and your skills, that’s essentially your CV. The other thing as well, which is something I used to look for, is to give specifics that align with the different positions at an organisation. The different people who employ you are going to look for different things. The creative director, for instance, will look for different qualities in a hire than an operations manager or a client service person. Understanding what different people are looking for, and being able to give solid examples of where you’ve done the thing they need you to do, is incredibly powerful for them. Do you recommend adjusting prices based on the opportunity a piece of work represents? Yeah, absolutely. There’s that saying that long-term, committed revenue is more valuable to you than short-term, higher revenue. So if you can guarantee even three days a week of work for three months, that is more valuable than getting a three day project here, and a two day project there. So there is a benefit to incentivize your client to hire you for a longer period of time by offering a reduced rate. The main thing to consider there is, if you do adjust your rate, you always want to make sure you’d be happy getting paid at that rate moving forward. What you don’t want to do is reduce your rate, sit quietly in the background, and say, “this is my rate, because I want this job”. Then your client might want to extend your contract for three months, but you hadn’t factored that in. Don’t screw yourself over.

Then your client might want to extend your contract for three months, but you hadn’t factored that in. Don’t screw yourself over. Whenever you’re putting a rate out there, there are a couple things you need to keep in mind. You either want to make sure that rate is sustainable – that you’d be happy to do that on an ongoing basis – or you offer them a special rate. I’m not a huge fan of discounting, but I think there are situations where it makes sense strategically, like if it’s a great opportunity that would be amazing for your portfolio, or if it gets you in the door for something else, then you can discount. But always let them know what your normal rate is. Let them know you are worth x, but for them in this instance, for this job, you’d be happy to do it for y because it’s something you’d love to be a part of, and you want to make sure you can fit in their budget. Always set the expectation that you are worth what you’re worth, which is usually way more than you charge. But then let them know they’re going to get a discount for this one piece of work, and you can renegotiate on the next piece of work. Why do you think freelancers and contractors struggle to pay themselves first? I think in business, whether you’re a business owner, entrepreneur, or freelancer, there’s this idea that paying yourself a decent salary is a reward. You hear it all the time: people saying it took them years before they could pay themselves anything. But the fact is, your salary is just a fixed cost, and you have to factor that into your pricing. You won’t make your salary if you don’t plan to, and the only person that’s stopping you from paying yourself is yourself. It’s one of those big mindset shifts that a lot of people have to make. Plan to earn a salary, and factor that salary in like you’d factor in the cost of hosting your portfolio online or paying for any of the tools or whatever that you need. You just factor your salary in as one of those costs and work it out from there. What’s the first step contractors and freelancers should be thinking about?

Try and understand the goal – where you want to get to, salary-wise, and how much you want to work in order to generate that salary – and then work backwards to how you can get there. So once you’ve worked that out, then it can be a case of saying: “Alright, so I need to get jobs that pay x amount of money. How do I get jobs that pay that?” And if you apply for them and you don’t get them, ask yourself what you might be missing. Is there a skillset or an area of expertise that you need to brush up on? Then go and make a plan to brush up on that area: either get some additional training or perhaps give someone a special rate for your services, just to get exposure and expertise. This means that next time you can put your price back up again, because you now have that experience. It’s about understanding where someone needs to get to for freelancing to not only be viable, but frickin awesome. Because that’s why we do this, right? To have a frickin awesome life with none of the grind and all of the freedom and flexibility. So ask: what do you need to be doing in order to make that goal a reality? What are all the steps you need to put in place in order to get there if you don’t know what that destination should look like? Otherwise, you might tweak your prices a little bit, but you’ll mostly keep doing more of the same stuff and end up burning out or feeling like you need to go and get a ‘real job’ because you need to pay the bills. Then you have that anxiety of thinking you have to have a contract because you have to earn every single month, otherwise you won’t have enough money in the bank. And that’s not a healthy, sustainable place to be for any length of time. Understanding what that destination looks like, so you can take the steps to get there, is really important.

The group began as a series of events in Auckland, run by founder and designer, Louise Kellerman, and has since grown into a business and a national hub for Kiwi designers. On October 16th, Design Assembly kicks off its “Spring Conversations” series with a pair of panel discussions in Wellington and Auckland. Ahead of this series, we chatted with Louise Kellerman about the origins of DA, its future, and the tips she has for freelancers who are thinking about starting their own businesses. How did Design Assembly start? I initially trained as a graphic designer at AUT and worked in the industry for about ten years before I started Design Assembly. There always seemed this lack of a specific community for graphic and visual design in New Zealand. So I started Design Assembly in 2008 as a series of events in Auckland and saw that there was a desire for people to connect offline. I was at a time in my career where I figured I’d found something I was interested in. I could use some of my skills and there was an opportunity there for me to make a living from it. I took it from there really. And alongside that, I’ve been continuing with freelance design work. It’s only in the last year or two that I’ve been working on Design Assembly more full-time. Hopefully, in the next twelve months, I’ll be devoting all my time to Design Assembly. How has Design Assembly grown over the last ten years? Since we started from that one event in Auckland, we’ve grown on a massive scale. At the moment, we have events in 4 or 5 centres throughout the country, in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Napier, a workshop series, and the website of content that gets all types of people contributing to it. So we maybe have around 20 evening events that happen year round. Back when we started, we weren’t running the Workshops so that’s grown out of it as well, and ten years ago the website was a very simple blog which just supported the evening events and that’s become an entity within itself. We’ve received funding from Creative New Zealand to write an essay series on the website and we have a podcast series as well, so it’s just grown hugely, like 100% in terms of its offerings.

It’s really grown into that initial idea of connecting, inspiring, and educating designers throughout their individual careers. What’s it like growing your own business? In running Design Assembly, I’ve learned to be very process-driven: creating the events and workshops programme, managing the local hosts and working with them on these events, looking for sponsorships, looking for revenue opportunities to make Design Assembly grow and make it sustainable. To that end, I’m making it about the community and not about me, the individual. So that’s how I’m managing it and trying to grow it, by being process driven and having a followed vision so people know exactly what Design Assembly is about, and they can come to it when they want to connect with other designers, collaborate, share information, get tips as to how other people have done things, and be inspired by the work that other designers are doing around them. What have been some outstanding challenges? The biggest challenge for me is trying to figure out how to make it into a sustainable business. It’s very much still a work in progress in terms of it’s not-for-profit in its model but it’s about making sure it’s going to be here into the future. So we’re trying to work out the revenue model, in terms of paying the people that are involved in the team to keep it going. So that’s definitely the biggest struggle, is making a living out of it. Why is New Zealand integral to Design Assembly? Design Assembly only focuses on New Zealand design work. We interview New Zealand designers and talk about issues that are relevant to the community here – so it’s all about New Zealand in that its total point of difference is that it’s speaking to the “New Zealandness” and diversity of cultures, people, and design practise that exists in here. And because we operate in four cities, with local hosts in each, we work with the New Zealand community as a whole and then every region has its particular quirks and interests as well. What are some of the major issues facing the design industry?

What advice would you give to someone starting out on their freelance journey? Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify in terms of where your income will be coming from. Look ahead, make sure you’ve got your eye on the ball in terms of what’s going to be happening revenue-wise, both longterm but also within the year. Plan quarterly and monthly so you can stay on top of it. Don’t be afraid of the numbers: knowing your numbers gives you some choices in terms of where you need to go. Pick up the phone. Call people that you admire in your industry or in an adjacent industry. People are always pretty happy to share stories of how they’ve done things and you might learn something new. And it’s quite good to have mentors that change throughout your career depending on what your focus is at the time, the particular area you’re working in or want to work in. Figure out what you’re good at and what it is that you want to do, and focus on that. Things take time so you’ve got to have that ability to work by yourself, and know that you’ll have hurdles along the way but you have to learn from those and keep going. There’s not really any instant gratification, there won’t be the instant success, and in some respects with Instagram and social media, in general, there’s that idea that it’s just sitting there, waiting for you to have the job you want to have, but you’ve got to do the work to get there. What’s next for Design Assembly? The vision for DA is to be the home of New Zealand graphic design, so continuing on that path by supporting designers on all their different career phases on their individual journeys – from high school students and teachers to tertiary students into their careers and then into professional designers and mentors.","metadata":{"namespace":"hnry.co.nz_theleap","filename":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_q-a-with-design-assembly-louise-kellerman_.txt","link":"https://hnry.co.nz/theleap/q-a-with-design-assembly-louise-kellerman/.txt","id":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_q-a-with-design-assembly-louise-kellerman__2"}}],["86",{"pageContent":"In the first of our ‘Quick-Read’ series, Stacey Cottrill discusses in three(ish) questions how she managed to overcome the challenges that come with freelance work. After taking control of her financial future, she was able to make some important life decisions like extending her mortgage to invest in a business. What are some of the challenges that come with being a freelancer? The obvious challenge that comes to mind is surety of income. It helped a lot once I had a contract for a specific amount of hours a week. It gave me that financial stability that I needed. I also reckon it’s a bonus to be contracting less than 40 hours a week, as anything less than that allows me the space to take on other work, offering more creative variety and a chance to extend my skills… And more importantly, I now get more time to bum about with my kids! Can you briefly describe the process of how you were able to extend your mortgage in order to invest in a business? I’ve been dreaming about investing in a new business for, well, ages. I realised if I didn’t get my ducks in a row, I’d miss the boat. And I hate missing boats. So I chatted to my bank who were supportive but naturally concerned about my status as a freelancer. The team at Hnry provided me with a report of all my income and expenditure to support my case. They emailed it through and I forwarded it onto the bank instantly. I think the promptness took the bank by surprise! Long story short, they approved the extension on my mortgage. Having that data at hand was great. I can honestly say that if I hadn’t been using Hnry, the task would have been too much for me and my creative head. And I’d probably be left standing on the dock, waving goodbye to that boat. So what are some ways in which you control your finances? Where do you get advice from? Having a mortgage is the best way for me to control my finances. As odd as it may sound, paying off my mortgage is how I actually save money. Before I had a mortgage, I had an automatic payment coming out of my account fortnightly: money that would be squirrelled away into an account I could not touch. I manage to get a lot of advice from talking to people and being open to unorthodox options.

Whilst recruiters are out placing freelancers and contractors in roles, we’re there to support those individuals in managing their financial obligations. Whether someone is a career contractor, or if they’re brand new to contracting, Hnry makes earning an independent income as simple and stress-free as earning via a salary job. Hnry gives recruiters and contractors alike the peace of mind that all of the financial admin has been taken care of. This means that recruiters can place candidates faster and with ease, adding immense value to their agency and the lives of their candidates. We sat down with a few recruitment agents to chat about how Hnry helps them: Dan Wharakura, Principal Consultant at H2R Technology Bernadette Sharkey-Burns, Senior Consultant at Momentum Sam Nowell, Principal Consultant at Potentia Steve Willoughby, Regional Manager, Techonolgy Transformation & Digital at Beyond Recruitment How does Hnry help when it comes to placing candidates? “It’s really easy to engage with you guys and get our contractors going,” says Steve. “So it’s a really valuable service for our contractors, and at a really competitive price. As recruiters, it’s just such an easy service to engage with.” “It’s a much more personalised service than anything else on the market. I always encourage using Hnry over going with a traditional accountant,” Bernadette says. Bernadette goes on to explain how her organisation really strives to have a full-service offering available for their contractors, an offering that gives them more time because “everyone has a busy life and not everyone is comfortable when it comes to doing their taxes. For us, Hnry is a great value-add for our contractors.” For Hnry’s recruitment partners, being able to offer the service to their contractors means that they can provide even more value to their organisation and streamline the set-up process. They’re able to place candidates faster and more confidently because they know that all of the tax admin is being handled by Hnry’s team of experts. “For candidates, joining the service is just seamless,” says Bernadette, “no matter your experience as a contractor.” And because we at Hnry don’t get involved in contracts or timesheets, recruitment agencies don’t need to worry about ‘integrations’ of any kind.

Once the contractor has signed up and set up their account, the recruiter can simply pay directly into the contractor’s Hnry Bank Account and from there the service will automatically handle all of the necessary tax obligations for that contractor. “Having Hnry on our side means that we have a genuine offering in the toolkit,” adds Sam from Potentia. “It’s really a one-stop shop, which means that people can have confidence in their contracting journey. It’s been really great to offer that safety net to our candidates.” “For us at H2R,” says Dan, “it’s a combination: supporting the candidate with an extension of the contracting experience, but also commercially it’s helping us to make sure we can fill vacancies. These parts are crucial, not only in getting someone set up and up and running with a contract, but also so that the candidate can feel confident in going into that contract. If that doesn’t happen, the contract might not get accepted and then the candidate doesn’t continue on in the process. If they get themselves into a position where it becomes too difficult, then they might just default back to looking at other work options, such as permanent employment.” How would you describe contractors’ interactions with Hnry? “Hnry just makes things simple,” says Bernadette Sharkey-Burns. “You’re a really responsive and customer-focused team, and for people to have access to that, I think that proves you’re very hands-on and you care about what you’re there to do. Your team wants to make sure that the people who are utilising the service are having a really good experience.” Hnry caters to both career contractors and those that are brand new to the world of contracting. “A lot of people find themselves in a position where contracting opportunities are available, but they just don’t understand how to get everything set up,” says Dan, whose wife and sister-in-law both use the Hnry service. “So for us, Hnry has been super valuable in this sense.” “Utilising Hnry means that nothing really changes for contractors if they’re used to being a PAYE employee and having someone else take care of it for them,” adds Bernadette.

Hnry customers get access to a full range of features (expense management, income allocations, financial insights and reports) that make it easy to work as a contractor. They can pick and choose the features that work best for them, all while operating with the confidence that everything is being handled in the background. One Hnry customer, for instance, joined the service about a year ago, and at the time, he’d been going through rough times. After getting laid off after twenty years as a permanent member of staff at an IT consultancy, he was left without much choice but to go out contracting. He soon found work through Talent International and, facing the unknown of all of the tax admin, was referred to Hnry. He immediately found that the service alleviated all of his fears. “Without Hnry, I would be living in constant fear of doing something wrong,” he told us at an event a few months ago. “It’s completely changed the way I think about my finances.” Sam Nowell shared a similar story: “We had a first-time contractor come through to Hnry recently – 18 years he’d been thinking about contracting. He’d built up a fear of it. He just wanted a soft entry into managing his finances as an independent contractor, and Hnry really alleviated some of the anxiety that he had. So that was a big win.” Hnry co-founder James Fuller remembers this customer: “What’s great is that we had those initial conversations with him, and it really didn’t take that much of our time to alleviate those fears. Now he seems super relaxed – in fact, now that he’s all set up, we don’t actually hear from him much anymore!” For Steve Willoughby from Beyond Recruitment, Hnry helped solve a lot of the anxiety that they themselves would normally have had to help mitigate. “The service that Hnry provides is seamless and quick.

No question is too difficult or too simple for the team to answer, and they’ll always talk to Hnry customers without the tax jargon or confusion that usually accompanies those conversations with IRD and accountants. “With Hnry, people feel comfortable that they can ask questions and be listened to,” adds Dan. Not only is the Hnry customer success team readily available, but we have an extensive collection of helpful resources and articles that help guide contractors (both career and brand new) through their careers. “People love it when we steer them to the resources and the website,” says Sam. “They have an interaction with you guys, and the information you provide, and they can have all of their questions answered, around how their taxes work and what their finances should look like. And so they always come back to us, even before signing the contract to say, ‘thanks for putting me on to Hnry – I feel a lot more comfortable.’’ “Often in our world, no news is good news,” says Steve. “But everyone that I reach out to for feedback about Hnry is really positive.” ~~~ As New Zealand’s fastest-growing tax agency, Hnry handles the tax admin for thousands of Kiwi contractors, helping them feel empowered and supported throughout their careers as independent earners.

When the policy was first announced, there was a great deal of confusion in the industry as to how it worked, who it would apply to, and what the impacts were. It required forms to be signed, tax rates to be selected, and it led to a huge amount of misunderstanding of what was required and by whom. In some cases, we heard that recruiters actually had to employ new staff to deal with the extra workload this policy placed on their agency. So how does ‘Withholding Tax’ actually work? When a self-employed individual starts work for a new employer or through a recruiter, that recruiter or employer may require them to select a rate of ‘Withholding Tax’ That individual will need to fill in and sign an IR330C form, selecting an elected rate of income tax anywhere between 10-40% for the recruiter/employer to deduct and pay on the individual’s behalf whenever they get paid That individual is then responsible for managing all further income tax calculations, payments, filings etc themselves, as well as managing any other taxes they’re subject to (GST, ACC and others) The process seems simple enough, until you start to hear how it is actually being applied by some recruiters and large employers. In some instances, independent workers are being recommended a tax rate to select. In other cases, they’re not actually being given a choice by their employer or recruiter as to which rate to select. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Over the last couple of years or so, we’ve heard some real horror stories. The perils of Withholding Tax ‘advice’ 1. In one example, a small employer of casual labourers was getting themselves embroiled in contractors’ tax affairs. They were mandating rates of withholding tax based on the type of work being done, and even varying the rate of withholding tax they deducted based on whether the individual was GST-registered. That’s the tax equivalent of paying extra money to your electricity provider because your grocery spending increased! 2.

In another incident, a brand new contractor took on a job for a large organisation and he was getting everything set up, the organisation told him the rate of tax he should be using. As he was new to contracting, he just assumed that this meant that the organisation was taking care of the entirety of his tax affairs. As he described it: They’re a big organisation - it seemed logical to me that they would just take care of all of this stuff. I had no idea what my responsibilities were, and the organisation made it sound as though this was all standard process for contractors As you can imagine, the contractor ended up underpaying income tax throughout the year, never held back any money for GST or ACC, and is currently trying to unpick a rather grisly situation with government agencies. 3. In maybe the most negligent of Withholding Tax stories, one recruiter wasn’t actually paying the tax through to IRD at all before paying their contractor. Instead, they directly passed on the gross amount. This contractor then went on to spend the money, thinking it had already been taxed. He didn’t set aside money for tax either, because througout the whole year he was under the impression that he was being compliant. So at the end of the financial year, he was hit by a massive tax bill that he was not at all prepared for, and was eventually placed on provisional tax. All of these are not isolated incidents. Time and time again we hear from contractors and freelancers who have effectively been given unqualified and inaccurate tax advice by their employer or recruiter. Most employers or recruiters seem unaware they are doing it, and don’t realise the risk it has for both their organisation and for the individual. Why are recruiters and organisations giving tax advice? When we talk to recruitment agents and organisations about this issue, the vast majority are just trying to be helpful in providing this advice. A lot of the time it is prompted by the individual themselves. Those working as contractors and freelancers can’t be expected to know the details of every piece of tax legislation, and when they’re asked, it’s human nature for these recruiters and organisations to try and be as supportive as possible by helping the individual out.

Providing tax recommendations can short-cut the time it takes to get someone placed in a role, meaning they can start work faster. One of the benefits of using contractors and freelancers is the ability to scale up your workforce very quickly - having to wait for each individual to work out an appropriate rate of tax themselves can be time-consuming, and therefore sometimes it is just seen as easier to provide a recommendation. For some however, this all comes down to a misunderstanding of how the policy actually works. There are some organisations out there that incorrectly believe it is their responsibility to determine and specify a tax rate for their contractors and freelancers, and they therefore voluntarily take on all this extra risk and effort. Why is this a problem? As mentioned in some of the examples above, having a rate of income tax recommended by a trusted agency or employer can give the individual false confidence that their income tax is taken care of - and in some cases that all their other taxes are taken care of as well. Added to this, because most self-employed people take on numerous different jobs at different rates throughout the year for many different agencies and employers, their income fluctuates greatly over time. Having some of those employers deduct a flat rate of tax is completely inappropriate and inaccurate, and will always leave the individual either overpaying or underpaying tax. This is made all the more difficult by the fact that each different employer will have no knowledge or context of the financial situation (or other income) of the individual - so they couldn’t possibly recommend an accurate rate of tax. Given this income fluctuation, selecting a linear rate of tax for some jobs significantly impacts the individual, who is then required at the end of the year to work out what tax was deducted by whom at which stage of the year. This always ends up with a big ‘wash-up’, and in our experience, resulting in the individual having to find money to pay a tax deficit. What are the impacts? We’re coming up to the second financial year where these withholding tax policies have been in place, so the true impacts are just beginning to emerge. For some, it comes as a shock that their income tax hadn’t been taken care of by their recruiter or employer, leading to stress, anger, and confusion over which taxes have and haven’t been paid, and ultimately leading to late filing penalties.

Some contractors weren’t even aware that they needed to file taxes in the first place - assuming that since tax was being deducted by their employer, they were effectively being paid PAYE. A lot of new freelancers and contractors have no idea that they needed to retain further money for tax, not to mention that quite a few have no idea how much to retain at all - particularly when it comes to some of the more complex taxes such as ACC levies. We’ve started to hear a few examples where contractors and freelancers are coming after the recruiters or employers, as they have been hit with a big income tax bill despite after following advice for a ‘recommended’ rate of tax. On more than one occasion, relationships between recruiters and their contractors seem to have soured, simply because the contractor believed they were provided bad tax advice by their recruiter. So what’s next? At the end of the day, it isn’t the responsibility of the recruiter or employer to select or recommend a rate of tax for the individual - nor should it be. It is for the individual to nominate a rate of tax that is appropriate for them based on their income. Recruiters and employers need to stay as far away from providing tax advice as they possibly can, as the repercussions of not doing so are huge. Alongside this, recruiters and employers still need to be able to onboard contractors quickly, and know that they are meeting all of their obligations. That’s part of the reason we started Hnry. We wanted to make sure we could work collaboratively with the recruiters, the employers, and the individuals to ensure that all the compliance responsibilities were taken care of quickly and easily - without burdening the employer or the individual by having them need to learn the complexities of all the policies themselves, and without the risk of making mistakes and being fined.","metadata":{"namespace":"hnry.co.nz_theleap","filename":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_recruiters-organisations-tax-advice-risk_.txt","link":"https://hnry.co.nz/theleap/recruiters-organisations-tax-advice-risk/.txt","id":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_recruiters-organisations-tax-advice-risk__3"}}],["95",{"pageContent":"Rob Woodward is a Founding Director at Find Recruitment, a recruitment agency that places contractors in Finance, Technology, Digital and Corporate roles. We chat to him about the ways in which recruitment has (and hasn't) changed since he originally got into the industry twenty years ago, and the process of establishing the Find agency. Tell us a bit about yourself and how you got into recruitment! I first started out as an investment banker and did that for nine years up until 1998 when I joined recruitment. I’ve been in recruitment for twenty years now. For the first nine years of that journey, I worked for a company called Momentum and then eleven years ago, myself and two colleagues, Mike McKay and Julian Greaves set up Find Recruitment. Later on, we were joined by our Business Partners Nick Calavrias, Simon Rooney, Pete Thompson and Josh Rea. Right now Find consists of a group of four companies in Wellington and Auckland, with 27 staff handling executive recruitment right through to IT through to corporate roles at the executive level. What was recruitment like in ‘98? One of the interesting comments someone made to me back then, when I was moving from investment banking to recruitment was: “why are you going to join an industry that’s dying?” At the time, there were big job boards (monster.com, for example) and other man-made technologies that were using e-options. People were saying “the role of the human is going to go”. As we can both see, recruitment hasn’t “died”. How has it evolved over the twenty years you’ve been in the industry? In terms of the mechanics of recruitment, the industry has broadly remained very similar over the last twenty years. Now that’s not to say that there are differences in how we look at AI and how our attitudes toward work and company culture are changing. Software, CVs and interviewing – these things are all evolving and getting better. But the industry is taking a lot longer to “die” than I think a lot of pundits said it would, twenty years ago. On the topic of AI, Google has been working on AI for selection processes for the last four or five years and has just canned the project because they found that their AI was generating a male bias. Now they were trying incredibly hard to get it to do the job of successful, objective selection but it inherently had a male bias.

And Google are at the top of the tree here, so you think if they can’t do it it’s still a long way away. In my opinion, as long as humans are hiring humans, traditional recruitment will have a role. So what was behind that decision to start your own recruitment agency? After working for one for so many years, what was it that you wanted to fix? The recruitment company we worked for was very successful but we found that its brand wasn’t as strong as our personal brand. People were ringing the individuals to speak to them directly, circumnavigating the brand because we’d created these personal attachments. Now this is quite common in the industry today, and at the time we knew that we could monetize that connection. We knew people would ring us and that we would provide an excellent service. We didn’t need a “brand umbrella” across the top. So that was the catalyst. We wanted to run our own ship. Moreover, I think the idea was to simplify. We were in that space where there were meetings: account meetings, management meetings and meetings for the meetings. We just stripped it right back and turned out to be really successful with it. How have you managed to grow as an enterprise while still maintaining that initial idea? That’s something we’ve really had to consistently work on. You know, it sounds like something simple but we have to work on it constantly, and we do. It might sound weird but we treat everyone as an adult. We don’t have KPIs. We don’t have budgets. We don’t have sales targets. In effect, we let people run their own businesses and we provide the tools and the support the need to do that. It really is as simple as that. We try not to overcomplicate things, we don’t put people on a treadmill, we don’t make them send x amount of CVs or attend y amount of meetings. The idea is just: “look, this is what we think creates successful outcomes. Model it, and see how you go.” I think the other important thing is that we work in the business ourselves; we are the owners that work amidst the other staff.

So people see us emptying the dishwasher, trying to place really tough roles and experiencing the ups and downs of recruitment. We work alongside our staff so that they know we’re in the trenches together. What do you see as differences in work now versus when you started out in the recruitment industry? There are new roles that come in almost weekly: social media analysts, for example, or cyber risk experts. When I started in ‘98, those roles just didn’t exist. We also had roles back then that we were placing – unit pricing accountant, for instance – which are gone now. So, we‘ve seen this evolution within the system. It’s the same when you look at the body of history. When you look back at blacksmiths and farriers, it’s obvious that roles have and will continue to change. Before the rise of internal recruitment teams, corporates were spending large amounts of budget on external recruiters. So that’s been cyclical – in-house recruitment teams have grown and then downsized and then grown again. The tools that internal recruitment teams have, like LinkedIn, allow them to be more effective – that’s been a big change. And LinkedIn especially is a tool that’s turned into more of a recruitment tool than a network tool. When we do our searches now, the software reads the CV – but there’s still a CV to be read. At the end of the day, we still need to understand the person: why they’re leaving their current job, what they liked and didn’t like about it, what their anxieties are, what their stretches are and what determines a good fit for them. We use human questions – that hasn’t changed. So do you feel people’s approaches to work have changed? One of the greatest drivers of the flexible labour market, or contracting in general, is the overall economic well-being of the people in it. During the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), people wouldn’t come out: maybe their partner had just lost their job and there was no way they would go contracting, maybe they had an outstanding mortgage. Maybe they had been contracting but the organisation they worked for said it would be much cheaper if they go on permanently, so they would.

These economic cycles dictated the flow and appetite of work, and as the economy gets better and stronger, people are more prepared to pay off their mortgage and feel more positive about taking that Leap. So self-employment comes roaring back. How have young people responded to the flexible labour market? Freelancing and contracting has allowed graduates to have a slightly more unstructured, easier start into the labour market. They might do a little bit here and there or learn a new skillset because the graduate roles are harder to get into. Once you’ve got one you’re away but how do you get that first one? So recent graduates are eager to be working $20 an hour for three weeks as it’s better than nothing. Graduates are still looking for mentors and structure. Contracting makes it a bit harder for this to happen as it’s a bit more piecemeal and there might be a number of different environments in which one will end up working. You learn a bit in this scenario but a lot of graduates and junior people are seeking a little bit more engagement early on, and will maybe go contracting in Year 3, 5, 7 or even 12. What about the older labour force? Has self-employment appealed to them as well? That’s a group that we haven’t really seen play out yet. As people are starting to live longer and as the pension may or may not go from 65 to 67, the “greybour” market will have more of a voice. Older people might say, “you know what, I’m going to work three days a week and I don’t really want to do bits here and there.” Imagine the circle that’s forming here: you’ve got the permanent labour market here that’s changing and trying to grab some of the contracting people back; you’ve got technology that allows self-employment to rise; then you’ve got the older labour force going, “hang on, how do we get a piece of this?” It’s a pretty fluid state at the moment: I wouldn’t say we’re roaring this way or that. It seems to be a zero-sum game. How would you rate New Zealand’s approach to self-employement and the nature of work itself?

Technology is getting stronger and stronger in the everyday workplace, which allows freedom from the workplace but sumultaneously allows movement around what the structure of work actually looks like. It’s sort of a balancing act, self-employement. Some people really react to having to be at their desk from 8-6, five and a half days a week. They’re going “bugger that, I’m going to work as a contractor”. The labour market is changing: employers are wondering how they can keep workers permanently because they really want their knowledge and to keep them as part of the team. If we push people too hard in one way, saying you must be at your desk and work these horrendous hours, people are more than willing to go into self-employment. But there are also organisations (like Perpetual Guardian with their 4-day work week) saying: “we can let people work from home and bring their dogs into the office – you don’t have to physically be here but please tie to us”. It’s a really interesting phase we find ourselves in: technology is forcing us to look at how we work and how we approach the idea of permanent work, self-employment, and student internships. And they’re all sort of working in concert at the moment and reacting to each other. Are we in a better position compared to other countries of similar size and population? Are we doing well on the global stage? I think so. I’m a Wellingtonian and I think even regionally some places are doing better than others. We’re a country of small businesses, though people do tend to have transport issues and mortgage issues. We know globally that New Zealand is doing rather well on the labour market front. There are some issues around transport and the cost of living in Auckland. There’s a lot of pressure there, and we’re really surprised that we’re not seeing as much of what we call ‘economic refugees’ – people who can’t live in Auckland and come and find a job in Wellington. We thought we’d be seeing more people like that at this point, and there are some, but not as many as we’d thought we’d see.

What do you think are some other positive outcomes of the self-employment? Pro: the agile, unstructured way of self-employment is breaking down barriers that traditionally have been present through age and race hierarchies. Technology is aiding that shift because people who aren’t New Zealanders who come here to work and have great tech skills automatically get a level of respect, which is what they should do of course. But now you’re seeing a 22-year old earning respect from a 58-year old manager, and because we’re working in an agile way we’re seeing relationships forming in a more collegial way. Con: introvert and extrovert biases. Traditionally, people who train as developers are introverts. But because we now are encouraging work in an agile way (fast-paced, stand-up and collegial) introverts are being pushed out of their natural working environment as we’re asking them to do it eight hours a day and they’re not getting a lot of time to heal. Introverts heal with quiet time; extroverts heal by being with people. And so we’re seeing more mental health issues with introverts working as developers in agile work environments.","metadata":{"namespace":"hnry.co.nz_theleap","filename":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_recruitment-in-the-21st-century-rob-woodward_.txt","link":"https://hnry.co.nz/theleap/recruitment-in-the-21st-century-rob-woodward/.txt","id":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_recruitment-in-the-21st-century-rob-woodward__5"}}],["101",{"pageContent":"Sarah Colcord – a freelance event and project manager – founded the New Zealand Made Products page on Facebook during lockdown. In just a few months, the page’s membership has grown to over 500,000 members. While the country was in lockdown, Sarah and her group of page moderators were busy running and growing one of New Zealand’s most needed community groups: a place where sole traders and small business owners could share their stories, advertise their products, and promote their brands. We sat down with Sarah to discuss the origin of the page and her experiences successfully growing its membership, and to share some of the standout stories of the page’s members. Who are you and what do you do? I’m Sarah Colcord. I’m 23 years old, and based in Auckland. I work full-time for a community law centre, and I also run an organisation that is the peak body for youth participation groups in Auckland. I’m self-employed as well – I’ve had my own event and project management business since 2017. So those are the three hats I wear, and the fourth one, which is the founder of the Facebook group New Zealand Made Products. Can you talk a bit about the origin of the Facebook group? Why do you think it’s grown so big, so fast? The Facebook group has only been in existence for five weeks now, and I started it out of a desire and a need to support small businesses across the country – businesses like mine – during this challenging time. I found myself in a situation where, as soon as lockdown happened, I lost my contracts. Events and projects aren’t really an essential service. Nobody could be out so a lot of events got cancelled. So I lost a lot of my contracts, and subsequently I lost income as well. And so I was trying to find a way in which I could still get work during this period of time, and boost the profile of my business as well, without having to resort to really expensive marketing costs, or even having to invest hundreds of dollars into Facebook advertising without much in return. So I had a look around, trying to figure out what other event management companies were doing to pivot during this time, seeing how other small businesses were doing in terms of their digital footprint and how they were responding during this time.

It had only been in existence for four months and with 1.5 million members, it’s very active and there’s a lot of engagement going on in the group. I thought there had to be a Kiwi version of it somewhere, where I could advertise my services and products. So I had a look around and there wasn’t anything like it. I didn’t want to post in my local community boards, because I didn’t think they were the right forum to post about my business. So I ended up creating New Zealand Made Products, noticing a gap and an opportunity to create a similar group to the Australian one, while also being able to boost the profile of my business and supporting other small and medium sized businesses across the country at the same time. What do you think has been key to the success of the page? I think it comes down to a lot of factors. Timing. Obviously it was a perfect time: everyone was in lockdown across Aotearoa. So there was a sense of disconnection: more people were rushing to get online, both personally and for their businesses – getting a business website or Facebook page set up. People were just more online. Demand. Businesses lost a lot of their income practically overnight. Lockdown forced people to try and find a place to promote their business, their products, and their services without having to pull money out of their pockets, pockets that might not be very deep. A lot of these small businesses, such as my own business, don’t have a lot of cash to invest into marketing, or even Facebook advertisements. So I think a lot of businesses were in a similar situation to myself: wanting to connect with people, but not sure how to go about it. Curation and quality. We get hundreds and thousands of submissions every day, and these submissions go through a process.

We have these guidelines in place to allow members to get the most out of their posts, and to be seen by as many people as possible before they get chucked into the endless scroll. Freebies. At the start of the group, to bring people in on that first week, I put up giveaways as a way for businesses to boost their profiles, but also to give back to the people in the group and to build momentum. That first week, I did a Whittaker’s giveaway because everybody loves Whitakker’s. That was the boost it needed in the initial stages to start bringing people into the group. From there, adding the other elements of curation and quality just helped boost the group a bit more, leading to that snowball momentum. What are some of the similarities and differences you experienced between starting your own event management business and starting this page? Starting the group was a lot easier than starting my business. Facebook makes it pretty easy for you to start a Facebook group, and I’m very lucky to also be skilled in graphic design and social media content. My full time job is as a social media coordinator. When I set up that Facebook group, it was very easy. I already had the skills and the knowledge from previous experience to be able to invest in that page and give it a good identity. Whereas, when I started my own business, I was coming in fresh: straight out of university, having just finished my graduate diploma in event management. Understanding theory is great, but the real life experience of having real life clients, managing finances, and everything else that comes with being a small business or sole trader, that was a lot like being thrown in the deep end.

Obviously, my profile as an individual has grown massively, and I’m very lucky that one of the groups that I work with quite regularly in my business is the Auckland Council. So there will always be work that comes through there, regardless of what’s going on in the world. Even though I had contracts postponed and cancelled, I still had that knowledge and awareness that there could possibly be contracts coming down the line with Auckland Council. Even though I haven’t had direct queries as a result of the group, my personal profile has grown quite a lot, and I’ve still had work come through my company. I was thinking this week that I should post about my company, because I’d love to get that exposure for the company itself, not just as an individual, and try and expand my client base to outside of the Auckland area because my clients are quite Auckland-based. For people in the group, alongside the success of selling their products, they’ve been able to connect with people across the country that they’ve never been able to do before. Do you have admin help with curating the page? Where are those people based? They’re based all around the country; one’s from Australia. I know half of them, but haven’t seen them in probably like two to three years. The other half I’ve never met before, but were referred to me because they’re moderators for other Facebook groups, so they had the experience. It’s a mixture of experienced and non-experienced moderators. I’m the only admin, because I’m very protective of my baby, but I have 17 moderators as of today, and they all work voluntarily, in and amongst their full time jobs and family commitments as well.

I get more than a dozen messages a day in my inbox from people – businesses, sole traders across the country – just expressing their gratitude and appreciation for the page. Probably the most well-known testimonial that has come through the group is of the lawn mower guy, down in Christchurch. He ended up being on Seven Sharp because his daughter posted on behalf of her dad – the owner of a lawn mower company that’s been in the family for generations. He didn’t even have a Facebook page, it was just a home number. She posted on behalf of her dad, who didn’t know she was posting. It blew up and he’s just had months of bookings in advance for him and his services. Another one, which I posted on my personal page, the person asked to be kept anonymous. She messaged me that she was the sole provider in the family during this time, because her partner couldn’t go to work. It was a risk to their daughter, who has a heart defect. She posted to the group about her products and services, and she now has months of bookings, and products that are selling out. She seemed to me that the group has literally enabled her to keep a roof over her head and food on the table. A funny story I always remember is of this clock. A husband messaged me and said that his wife had made this clock during lockdown. The numbers were in Te Reo Maori, and this clock was supposed to be just for the wall. She took a photo, posted it in the group, and then by the end of the day, they had sold 120 clocks. They then found themselves having to spend lockdown creating these clocks. He messaged me saying he just thought it was hilarious, that clock was just supposed to be for their wall. I thought that was awesome. Stories like that make all of the late nights worth it.

It forced us to look into our own backyard as to what we have here. What can we buy now? We have a very consumerist society: we want things now, and that attitude didn’t stop during lockdown. People were still looking to buy things, they were then forced to try and find a local place to do that.

I’d say just start tinkering: refine your models, your products, your services, and just get into the Facebook group. Fingers crossed that you get as many clients as possible. There’s a lot of opportunity in this group, especially for new businesses, and exposure to a global market because about 30,000 of the members in the group aren’t actually from New Zealand.

This can be for a few different reasons. Perhaps you can’t be certain about your long-term income because you frequently move between clients and jobs. It can also be a challenge to actually know how much of your income is available for you to spend or save. The way the tax system is set up, it can be difficult to do anything other than just put some proportion of your money away, and hope that it will be enough to cover your tax bill. It’s also difficult to plan or invest in your future, because banks and other institutions are all set up to favour those who have permanent jobs, and make it harder for people who are self-employed to get access to services like mortgages, loans or insurance. The impact of not being able to plan for the future can be huge. A recent article noted that “While Australia’s superannuation pool sits at $2.5 trillion and growing, the rise of tself-employment and regular job swapping have become problematic for a superannuation system designed for full-time workers” As the world moves towards a model where more and more people are selling their services on casual, short term contracts, it’s clear that the responsibility for planning for the future firmly lies with the individual. So how can you best plan for the future as a self-employed person? We’ve compiled a quick list of 3 things you might want to do: 1.

Are you currently earning more or less than this time last year? What does your pipeline of work look like? Making decisions about your future can be really well informed if you’re able to take a look back over what has happened in the past, and make some educated predictions about the direction your income is headed in. 2. Make voluntary KiwiSaver/Superannuation contributionsBeing self-employed, you probably don’t get the luxury of having an employer that contributes towards your KiwiSaver or Superannuation - so it’s something you need to arrange for yourself. It sounds obvious, but by taking a set percentage of your income and putting it away into your KiwiSaver,","metadata":{"namespace":"hnry.co.nz_theleap","filename":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_self-employed-future_.txt","link":"https://hnry.co.nz/theleap/self-employed-future/.txt","id":"hnry.co.nz_theleap_self-employed-future__0"}}],["108",{"pageContent":"an employer that contributes towards your KiwiSaver or Superannuation - so it’s something you need to arrange for yourself. It sounds obvious, but by taking a set percentage of your income and putting it away into your KiwiSaver, you can start to build up that nest-egg that’ll come in very handy in the future. In addition to this, if you meet the minimum contributions, you can get a Member Tax Credit (MTC) from the Government here in New Zealand each year. 3. Know your financial positionGetting confident and comfortable about what you can afford to save for the future, and what you need to cover your regular outgoings can be really tough as a self-employed individual. Planning out a budget of your regular expenses, and getting comfortable with how much is left over for you to be able to put into savings can be a really useful way of getting confident about how your savings might grow over time. In addition, (and it might take a while to get up to speed on this), but getting right down into the detail of exactly how much of each different tax you need to pay, when the payment dates are, and ensuring you’re holding on to exactly the right amount of tax can certainly give you comfort that you know what’s yours to spend or save. Hnry provides a service that helps self-employed people accurately plan for their future - without having to take on the burden of working everything out themselves: Pay all your taxes as you earn, so that you always know that what you receive is yours, allowing you to plan and budget the right amounts to put away for the future. When you get your self-employed income paid into your Hnry account, the exact right amount of every tax is paid immediately, so you never have to worry about it. Automatically make KiwiSaver contributions every time you get paid, to ensure it’s not something you have to ever think about or do for yourself. Just like when you have a permanent job somewhere, Hnry ensures the KiwiSaver contributions get deducted before you get the money, so you always know you’re putting something away for the future. Receive Pay Summaries (like a payslip) every time you get paid, showing how much you’ve earned and what taxes you’ve already paid through your Hnry account.

Most of the self-employed people we’ve talked to over the past few months said that they’d like to start investing in stocks and funds over the next five years – yet, there are many people out there who can’t achieve this goal because they earn an unsteady income that can vary within months and even weeks. In fact, a significant portion of self-employed people do not currently allocate money towards investments because of the “barriers” that accompany self-employment. So we sat down with our friends at Sharesies to talk about how they’re empowering people to start investing, regularly and in small chunks. Through their top investment tips for self-employed people, Sharesies are helping to change the world of personal investment for all. For some self-employed people, being able to invest has traditionally been out of reach - have you seen that changing over time? Absolutely! Investing has traditionally been designed for those able to part with large sums of money on a consistent basis. While this has worked for some people, the lack of flexibility has been a big barrier for others. Online investment platforms are helping to break down the barriers that once made investing inaccessible for self-employed people. For example, Sharesies is designed for investing affordable amounts, regularly, over a long period of time. You can buy, sell, and withdraw your investments whenever you want—and invest from as little as $5! Greater flexibility means greater accessibility and freedom to invest in the ways that work for you. What are some of the trends that you’re seeing in New Zealand, in terms of how people manage their finances in relation to investing? This year, we interviewed 1000 Kiwis to learn more about how people spend, save, and invest their money. We were interested to learn that the majority of Kiwi investors are Auckland-based males over the age of 60! Is the face of investing changing? We like to think so! Currently, 80% of the investors on Sharesies are under the age of 40 and evenly split between men and women. 33% of the Kiwis we interviewed said that they would consider buying shares with their savings, and 59% said that they could invest $5 a day without changing their spending habits. With investing becoming more accessible than ever, it’s super encouraging to see more New Zealanders jump in and give investing a go!

That’s great to hear that the barriers to investment are lowering. So what tips would you give to a self-employed person who is just about to start their investment journey? Set up KiwiSaver—put small amounts aside throughout the year to make use of the Government’s annual member tax credit. Learn by doing: you don’t need to know heaps to get started. Start small and grow as you go! Dollar-cost averaging: invest an affordable amount, regularly, regardless of what the price is…and stick with your investments for the long-term! Diversify your investments: whether it’s spreading your money across different regions, investment options, or something else entirely, don’t put all your eggs in one basket! How would you compare the level of financial literacy when it comes to investing in New Zealand versus other similar countries? When it comes to investing in shares, our research suggests that New Zealand is lagging behind other countries. 40% of Australians and half of all Americans own shares, but only 20% of Kiwis own shares—in fact, 4% of all Kiwis don’t have investments at all and aren’t planning on getting any investments in the next 5 years! A big part of this is a lack of knowledge: only 35% of the people we interviewed said they understand how investing works. Knowledge is power, and those who feel knowledgeable about the share market are more likely to own shares. As a country, we still have a long way to go but we hope that in opening up the conversation around money we’ll be able to share the knowledge and help New Zealanders feel more confident about the financial decisions they make. What’s the one thing you’d like to see change about the way that Kiwis manage their finances and plan for the future? We’d love to see Kiwis feel more confident, empowered, and knowledgeable about investing! Whether it’s starting small, talking about money with their friends and family, or setting up a Kids Account for the young people in their life, we’re excited to see Kiwis take steps to grow their wealth and share their investment experience with others!

Like any freelancer, I was wondering when I was finally going to get paid. It had dragged on for weeks. I was on the phone with a PA who was willing and able to lend a hand, pleading my story of boarding a plane to Fiji to get married. It appeared to be helping. Could they make the payment happen in time? Many of you will be all too familiar with that uncertain feeling you get when you submit an invoice for work you’ve just accomplished. You’ve done a stellar job, the manager who ordered the work is happy as, and now you just want to get paid at hyperspeed. When you’re just starting out contracting and money’s only flowing in fits and starts, submitting an invoice feels like you’re pitching your bill into a black hole – the machinations of some huge institution that may one day deem it somehow appropriate to actually compensate you for your blood, sweat and tears. It feels so beyond our control. How do we handle that? Thankfully I finally found someone on the end of a phone line who could make sure my invoice was processed and paid out just in time for the wedding. It wasn’t long before I was poolside at a tiny island resort, happily married and marvelling at the wisdom of honeymoons. What a great idea. But how do we generally handle things beyond our control? When you’re an independent earner, just finding enough work in the first place can appear uncertain. It can seem like the world is something that “happens to us”, which impacts our ability to plan for it. If we let it, that puts us on the road to becoming victims. The trick is to keep your “controllables” in sight much more than your “uncontrollables” – to focus on those things we can influence and shape. You’ve got a lot more power and agency than you might think. Where to begin? If you’re just getting started sorting out your finances and are not sure where to begin, we’ve come up with some key steps that will help you prioritise. Here are six steps to getting ahead financially: Start your safety net. Before you build up a fully-fledged emergency fund, a starter safety net of $1,000 can cover you for many unexpected events (eg, that phone repair!) that are bound to happen.

Before you build up a fully-fledged emergency fund, a starter safety net of $1,000 can cover you for many unexpected events (eg, that phone repair!) that are bound to happen. Here’s more on how to start yours. Get your KiwiSaver settings right. Just because you’re self-employed doesn’t mean you can’t make KiwiSaver work for you. There’s still the government’s contribution of $521 each year and market returns from your money being invested. Here’s where to tune up your KiwiSaver. Start tackling your debt. Here we’re after the high-interest stuff in particular, which is costing you the most. Here’s more to help you become debt-free. Cover your people, your money, your stuff. This one’s all about protecting what’s most important using insurance products, wills, enduring powers of attorney, etc. Here’s how to get cover. Run your retirement numbers. Nailing your retirement figure early gives you more time to achieve the lifestyle you’re after. Have a look at your long-term numbers here. Set your targets, then hit them. This one’s all about your goals in life and dialling up your wellbeing using money. Here’s where to set goals for the short, medium and long terms. Feel free to tax yourself When you’re self-employed, obviously you need to make sure to take care of taxes, and online platforms like Hnry can make this easier than ever to do. They’re also great at helping you funnel your money where you need it to – especially to smooth out the bumpy income that can come with contracting. If you think about why the tax system works, why KiwiSaver works, it’s because the money is taken straight out of our pay before we can do something else with it. We get used to it not flowing through, and it gets taken care of behind the scenes. The good news is we can use this same technique to get what we want as well. It’s called “paying yourself first” – which basically means that instead of waiting until everyone else is paid and then trying to squirrel something away for your goals, you set up automatic allocations to make sure your pay is flowing where you want it to first. When you “set your targets” in step 6 above, for example, you want to take advantage of allocations to make sure you hit your goals for the short, medium and long term.

Get strategic with your investing Fintech solutions like Hatch, which opens up the US sharemarket to investors here, are providing investment solutions like never before. But before you dive headlong into share investing, it’s important to be strategic. To invest well, you want to figure out what kind of investor you are, and Sorted’s investor kickstarter can help. Everyone typically has an investment mix – a proportion of shares, property, bonds or cash that you hold within your overall portfolio. Which mix is right for you? This depends on why you’re investing, and what you’re aiming to achieve specifically (and not just generally getting richer). This brings us back to your goals. Knowing the mix you’re after will drive your decisions. You can’t really dive in until you know what proportion of your portfolio should be shares, for instance.

We didn’t either, but apparently it is a real thing. It makes sense: the days are longer and the flowers have blossomed. You’ve already cleaned up your home so why not clean up your financial situation as well? Springtime seems as good a time as any to think about how you manage your finances. To prepare for October, we talked to a lot of self-employed people about how they manage their finances. We know that everyone handles their money differently, getting insights from all sorts of sources, so we were interested to hear about all of the behaviours out there. We sent out surveys, called up customers and took some time to get to know our people. We’ll be releasing more of this data over the coming weeks but for starters, here are a few insights into the wide swath of people who consider themselves self-employed: The majority (roughly 44%) of self-employed people we asked have been earning self-employed income for between one and four years. Moreover, we found that there was a fairly even split between people who had earned self-employed income for longer than eight years and those that have been earning for less than one. It’s safe to say that self-employment affects a great number of people, all of whom find themselves in various socioeconomic groups. We’ve also seen, to quite a unanimous extent, that money really does make the world go round. It goes without saying then that financial goals, those dreams we have for our money, act as important drivers for people. Whether you’re self-employed or make a living at a permanent job, we all want to feel like our money is empowering us to build for good futures through those financial goals we’ve put in place for ourselves. From the self-employed people we asked, the most common financial goals people had were: Investing in stocks & funds Paying off debts Saving for retirement In other words, the same financial goals are found across social groups, no matter how you earn your income. So it surprised us that, of the self-employed people we asked, one-third did not feel they could achieve their financial goals in the next five years. Why do self-employed feel they can’t hit their financial goals? A large barrier for people wanting to enter self-employment is the loss of financial “security” that a traditional nine-to-five offers.

We’ve talked before about how the self-employed can get started on their path towards career autonomy, and offered some financial advice for the self-employed – but the financial barriers can still be very difficult to navigate. The question then becomes, “where do you allocate your money?” We know that people want to plan for their future via a set of financial goals. But keeping a detailed plan of where you’re putting your money each month is easier said than done, especially if you have a time of the month that’s particularly money-tight, when rent is due and bills have to be paid, and yet you haven’t been paid yourself. Things like investing in stocks and funds and your KiwiSaver account, or trying to pay off debts, they all become even more difficult to manage if you’re feeling that “crunch time” each month. If you haven’t seen it yet, we recently launched our new sister site, The Leap, where we provide community, content and support specifically for the self-employed. This month we decided to theme The Leap around financial empowerment for the self-employed: from allocating money for long-term investments like mortgage payments, stocks, and superannuation funds, to charitable giving and family support. Here at Hnry, we want to financially empower you in any way we know how. Not only do we handle taxes and compliance for the self-employed, hassle-free, but we’ve also paired up with some great Kiwi companies that can help give you extra financial support.

By doing this, they can have some protection against periods of low income, and find new ways to leverage their skills and broaden their career. We’ve put together a quick list below of the different ways that we’re seeing people earn some extra income. If you’re a freelancer or contractor, or you’re looking to supplement your income, you might want to see if any of the below might be options for you: 1. Create a profile on online platforms In the past few years, some global online platforms have sprung up to match up those with skills, to those that need skills. Whether it’s for design, development, odd-jobs or recurring projects, platforms like Fiverr, Upwork and Freelancer.com can provide a way to ply your trade without leaving the house. For a more local flavour, you might want to try portals such as Unicorn Factory, Skale and Freelance Village. By creating profiles on these sites, you’ll make yourself known to local Kiwi businesses who may need anything from Graphic Design to Web Development through to Brand and Marketing. The people who run these sites are super-helpful, and are always keen to support the Kiwi freelancer community. 2. Create and sell products online If you’ve got a creative spark, there are a bunch of different ways that you might be able to earn some additional passive income online. Setting up your own online store, or using a 3rd party platform to sell designs might be a good way to keep things ticking over. For instance, Amazon KDP is an online service that allows you to sell your eBooks or Paperbacks on the Kindle store. If you’ve written a book, or you have a topic you could write on, publishing it on KDP could be a good idea. A lot of graphic designers are moving towards writing illustrated children’s books as a side-hustle, and KDP is a great platform to do it on.

If you wanted to go beyond books and T-Shirts, Redbubble is a great site that allows you to add your designs to Stickers, Device Cases, Posters and lots more. Again, they handle the fulfilment, so it’s just down to you to provide the designs. If you’re after something a little more complex, print on demand sites like Printify can provide a fulfillment and printing back-end for eCommerce platforms like Etsy, Ebay or Shopify. With hundreds of different products to choose from, such as hoodies, mugs, bags and decor, a weekends’ work can have you set up with an online store selling your designs globally. If all else fails, selling goods on TradeMe is always a sure-fire way of bringing in some extra income - whether you’re selling your own work, or just clearing some space in your home. As a rule though, you’ll need to make sure anything you sell is safe, clean and able to be transported by post! It’s worth noting that at times, TradeMe place restrictions on the shipping of items - such as during the COVID-19 lockdown period. 3. Create an online course With more and more people working from home, or learning from home, there’s never been a better time to create an online course. If you have a transferable skill that you believe others might want to learn, platforms like Udemy and Teachable are great ways to earn some extra income through teaching. Once you’ve signed up and created a profile, you’ll need to create content for your course. You can choose the number of lessons, design the content and have complete control over how your course works. Once that’s done, you can go ahead and start marketing your course to others (perhaps start with your existing social media networks - Instagram / Facebook / LinkedIn etc) to hopefully gain some initial students. There are also some useful online platforms where you can make money teaching English to overseas students, such as First Tutors, and more general online job platforms like Glassdoor. 4.

For example, we’ve recently seen a large number of personal fitness trainers taking their classes online - using live-streaming services like YouTube, Instagram (and in some cases, Twitch) to earn ad revenue and subscriptions for their classes. Using platforms like LiveStorm to run your own webinar series can also provide an additional income stream, allowing you to teach classes, provide advice or impart any skills you might have, with individuals paying to register for your webinar sessions. 5. Beware of ‘get rich quick’ schemes Often when times get difficult or income slows down, it can seem like an easy option to look into multi-level marketing, pyramid selling, or other ‘get rich quick’ schemes. They can often be advertised with tag lines such as ‘make $$$ from home’ and have stock photos of individuals with suspect testimonials about their amazing successes with such schemes. Whilst a handful of individuals certainly profit from such schemes, the vast majority of people don’t, and very often they can actually end up losing more money than they make. 6.

Tell us a bit about yourself and what you do for a living! My name is Tabitha Arthur, and I run a business called Tabitha Arthur Photography. I’m a photographer specialising in portraiture, basically. I take modern, flattering headshots through to contemporary magazine-style portraiture (think Vanity Fair magazine). Clients come in and they enjoy a beautiful makeover with a professional hair and makeup artist from my team, and then they have a professional photo shoot session with me. I reassure my clients that they don’t need to have watched 17 seasons of America’s Next Top Model, and know how to pose. It’s about the experience, so I guide and coach my clients every step of the way. What do you love most about your work? I always want to get to know my clients and the reasons behind them wanting to have a photoshoot. Often it’s maybe on their bucket list, or they’ve gone through big changes in their life, or maybe they’ve got kids and they want their kids to have a photo of them one day. One of the last clients I saw before lockdown had been going through some hard times, and she and I had what I call a ‘tears and tissues’ session. It’s really powerful when people see themselves reflected back. They see this strength, this wahine toa looking back at them. They can see their history and they’re like: “I am strong, I am a kind and warm person and I can see that in this photo. They can see these different facets of themselves reflected back in the photo. Another client wrote me this email that was just beautiful, which I brought to my hair and makeup team. She wrote to me to say that her fiance and her friends would say lovely things to her, but she could never understand or believe why.

Things just sort of opened up for her. Clients get to experience so much more confidence through our shoots. They’re able to go out into their relationships with their partner, their family, their friends, their colleagues and feel more uplifted, more empowered. They can walk into their boss’s office and say, “I’m really good and I deserve that raise.” How does that feel, seeing so many different types of people come into the studio and working with them to have those revelations? Oh, I have the best job in the world. And the more I do it, the more incredible it is. The more I do it, the more I have to give. I could never go back to any other sort of job. It’s such an honour to be able to do this for clients. Earlier this year, I opened up the studio to my hair and makeup team so that they could really understand what it meant to be one of my clients. They all took turns making up each other and stepping in front of my camera, just to experience a little slice of what clients would experience, so when they’re talking to clients they can really understand and speak from the heart about that process. That really helped me truly value what I do. I used to struggle with even saying the word ‘money’. When asking for money, or sending an invoice, I would sit there and struggle with what number to put on the invoice, struggle to press ‘send’ on that email, struggle to even have those conversations. I came from a scarcity mindset where sayings like “money doesn’t grow on trees” were common. So I guess I didn’t realise that that wasn’t really the case around money. The only limited resource we have is time. Time is the most precious thing. Money is going to always be there for us and I was essentially pushing it away because I didn’t value it. I didn’t understand the true value and the exchange of energy.

I get that balance now, and the more I do this, the more I’ve been able to truly feel that. Speaking of time and money, can you talk a bit about your lockdown experience? As a portrait photographer, I obviously wasn’t shooting. Instead, I used the lockdown as an opportunity to take a pause and look at what I’ve achieved and where I’m at in my business, and where I want to head. I used lockdown as an opportunity to smarten up my processes, look for areas that I know I’m not so strong in, and learn and upskill, so I can create an even better experience for my clients going forward. The term ‘pivoting’ is one I often hear overused these days. But I feel like I used lockdown to really plant my foot in the ground and dive into all sorts of areas of my business to learn and grow. Obviously it’s tricky because the money flow just wasn’t there. With my business, I was starting to see some income consistency. I was about to do my biggest month in sales, and looking to double it the following month, and heading towards my goal of doing $330k in a year – which is where I want to head as a business. I didn’t have the business knowledge when I started, and I have a business mentor now, so I was really seeing where I could go with my future and seeing what was possible, having dipped my toes in the water for the last few months. I’ve tested it, and now I can see that it’s working, and I can scale it up. I was ready to go ahead, and I had all of these clients lined up, but I then had to reschedule everything. It’ll happen, I’ll reach that goal, but it’ll just take a bit longer than I was expecting. There are always things that can go wrong, and this pandemic is a particularly unusual thing, obviously, and it affects the entire world.

Running a business comes with heaps of complexity and admin, but hopefully Hnry helps you get your time back to be able to focus on your work. Can you describe that before and after feeling, when you found Hnry? I talk about this all the time! The way I used to visualise tax before Hnry was me lying in a foetal position in the corner of a darkened room, holding myself and rocking back and forth – that was me if the word “tax” was ever mentioned to me. The word “spreadsheet” gave me hives. I found it so confusing and so hard and impossible. With all of these terms, I’d ask what does any of it even mean? Nothing would stick in my mind and I had a really fixed mindset around tax and anything to do with it. I resented tax, and I resented having to pay tax on any of the small amount of money I’d get. But then I started to learn about it a bit more. The more tax I’m paying, the more money I’m actually earning – so that’s awesome, number one. And number two is that a third of what I earn wasn’t even mine anyway, so I needed to build that into what I was charging, because that just isn’t mine. It’s tax. When I discovered Hnry, immediately I thought that it looked friendly. It looks not all technical, not at all like the IRD website (which looks like the most unforgiving, official, scary thing). So what’s it like using Hnry? Hnry is so friendly and accessible for a creative person such as myself. And I’m able to ask dumb questions in the chat box, I’ll get a response back from a real person in the team so quickly: a response from someone who is so kind and has humour and will help me out and they’ll either answer my question personally or turn me onto articles that have been written by the team.

It’s automated – it doesn’t feel like a bad thing. I also love the ease of use.

Tricks and treats abound, and adults and kids alike are getting into costumes and getting into the spirit: sharing stories of things that go bump in the night and watching scary movies together. So we thought we’d pitch in with some horror stories of our own, all about that all-too-terrifying subject: tax. Hnry was started in the wake of a particular tax and compliance ‘horror story’, when co-founders Claire and James Fuller, who had recently gone out contracting, were hit with an out-of-the-blue ACC bill. Their accountant hadn’t been making ACC payments (accountants do not do this for you), and so Claire and James were caught out. They were unknowingly placed on the default job type – ‘Manufacturing’ – which, as it happens, is the highest levy rate. We’ve come across a number of stories from people who have been in similarly grim situations. From elusive accountants and mysterious misinformation, to mistakes, oversights, IRD audits and massive tax bills, these horror stories are both common and chilling. Here’s a collection of #taxhorrorstories that might keep you up at night (though probably not): The tale of the missed withholding tax The case of the inconsistent recruiter The gross reality of gross income Expensing at a cost Deceptive coverage by an elusive accountant Mysterious misinformation The tale of the missed withholding tax A friend of a Hnry staff member was told by their recruiter to select 20% withholding tax on their IR330C, when he really should have been on a much higher rate. So at the end of the year he ended up with a big income tax bill that could have been avoided if he’d been placed on an accurate withholding tax rate from the beginning. Top tip: your clients can’t tell you the rate of withholding tax to deduct; it’s up to you to select the rate that’s right for you. Alternatively, you could use a service like Hnry that automatically adjusts your tax rate based on income earned throughout the year. The case of the inconsistent recruiter In one case, we heard of a recruiter that wasn’t paying an individual’s withholding tax through to IRD, despite them having filled out an IR330C. Instead, they paid them the gross amount directly, which led to a misunderstanding as to how much tax had already been paid on his earnings.

Instead, they paid them the gross amount directly, which led to a misunderstanding as to how much tax had already been paid on his earnings. He ended up spending money as if it had already been taxed, when he should have been holding onto the amount that was withheld (but not paid) for tax. This led to tax bills and, eventually, him being put on provisional tax. Top tip: whenever taking a new contract position, always be sure that you have got all of the information at hand to be able to make smart financial decisions. The gross reality of gross income A friend of ours had recently moved to New Zealand from overseas, found a job through a recruiter, and was under the impression that he’d been employed permanently for that role. He assumed he was having all of his taxes paid with each payslip, just like with a PAYE job, so he went ahead and spent his income as he normally would. At the end of the year IRD came calling, and so in his first year of contracting he was already tens of thousands of dollars in debt, all because of some miscommunication when he started his contract. Once you pick up a tax bill, you could be placed onto provisional tax and then have to make eye-watering payments to the IRD at regular intervals throughout the year. And once you get started down that hole, it can be tough to pull yourself out. Top tip: always check your contract to see whether you’re a contractor or a permanent memeber of staff and check to see whether or not someone is deducting your tax, and if so, how much they’re deducting. Expensing at a cost One recent story involved someone choosing to expense toilet paper for their home office. They had set a 10% proportion for their home office, and were therefore able to claim 10% of the purhcase, which came out to about 80 cents of $8.00. How much time did this person spend in order to get such a minimal amount of tax relief? At the end of the day, it seems pointless to raise expenses for 80 cents’ worth of expenses when this amount is a drop in the bucket for this particular person. We live busy lives – why waste time raising receipts on worthless expenses? Top tip: be smart when raising expenses and ask yourself whether what you’re claiming for directly relates to the livelihood of your business. Honesty gets you much further than cutting corners.

Dubious coverage by an elusive accountant When new Hnry customers sign up to the service, we tend to hear stories of their lives before finding us. They’re often fed up with their existing accounting set-up and illusory nature of the coverage they thought they were paying for. “I would pay my accountant for a year’s worth of work,” said one Hnry customer, “and at the end of the year we would meet and they would print off all the data I’d entered into their accounting software throughout the year. He’d hand it to me, asking ‘is this correct?’ At the end of the day, isn’t this what I’m paying them for?” Top tip: if you’ve got enough complexity to your financial situation and therefore need to have an accountant, then make sure you’re getting good value for your money. Mysterious misinformation Personal trainers are often erroneously told that they don’t need to pay income tax or ACC in their first year of earning independently, when really you need to pay tax on any income you earned during the financial year. We aren’t sure where this rumour arose, but in whichever industry you’re in, it doesn’t matter if it’s your first or fiftieth year of work – income is income, in the eyes of IRD. We’ve done some work to try and dispel this rumour, and if it’s not quelled soon enough, it’ll lead to even more horror stories in the years to come. And there’s even a lot of misinformation around general tax knowledge that we’re hoping to clear up. What is GST? What can I claim as a legitimate business expense? What is the difference between withholding tax, income tax, provisional tax, and all of the other tax terms? Top tip: if you’ve been told information by a friend or family member, always double check with a subject authority to ensure that what you’re hearing is accurate.

Rates are charged by the minute, the hour, the day or even as a set price for a one-off job. It’s not just for Uber… People often associate the idea of the Gig Economy with firms like Uber, AirBnB and Fiverr - it’s seen as a very new concept however in reality, this sort of working pattern has been around for a long time - in the form of the self-employed workforce. Whilst the ‘Gig Economy’ seems to represent the shift of self-employment into digital platforms and online marketplaces, the underlying idea of two parties negotiating a price for a short term contract for services, (rather than engaging in a long-term employment agreement) has been around for many years. Over the coming years, the uptake of the Gig Economy is predicted to increase exponentially, with predictions that by 2020 the United States will see a 500% increase in individuals taking advantage of self-employment opportunities. What does it mean for NZ Inc? Organisations and individuals in New Zealand are already taking advantage of this growing trend, and for many years some industries have totally relied on the services of a self-employed workforce (Taxi Drivers, the Film Industry, Barber’s to name but a few) As more and more organisations and industries look to take advantage of a more on-demand workforce and shift away from the overhead of ‘permanent staff’, there are some key concepts that organisations will need to become comfortable with: Changing work patterns: One of the advantages for self-employed individuals is the ability to work flexibly, taking on a volume of work that meets their own personal goals. Organisations will need to be cognizant that self-employed staff may not only want to work on a flexible schedule, but they also may want to work for multiple organisations at the same time. Taking advantage of a global workforce: The rise of online marketplaces like AliBaba and Amazon have enabled the global goods trade, and in the same vein Gig Economy marketplaces such as Fiverr have enabled self-employed individuals to sell their services globally. As more and more individuals embrace self-employment and the opportunity to sell their services globally, so organisations will in turn need to adapt and be open and able to take advantage of a more globally sourced workforce.

Attracting top talent: As it becomes the norm for individuals to sell their services in this way, organisations will need to shift their employment models to cater for attracting the best self-employed talent. As of today, most organisations look to attract talent using traditional salary and benefit packages, offering the incentive of a ‘job for life’ should the applicant be successful. As more flexible working becomes the norm, organisations will need to look at other incentives to attract the best people - offering incentives that are directly applicable and valuable to a self-employed individual. What does it mean for Kiwis? There are currently over 300,000 individuals in New Zealand who are, or have at some point been in self-employment [citation needed]. Being self-employed here in New Zealand is far from unusual. Some have taken up self-employment voluntarily to pursue a hobby, a dream or a new career path, whilst others have had to become self-employed simply because those are the expected working practices of their industry. (e.g Courier Drivers are mostly independent individuals) Becoming a self-employed individual brings with it some huge advantages: The opportunity to set your own path: Being self-employed provides individuals with a huge range of opportunities in terms of where they can apply their skills. Some individuals choose to pursue self-employment alongside their existing ‘permanent’ employment, allowing them to dabble and experiment with a ‘side hustle’ as a way of earning some additional income Flexibility of roles: Self-employment allows the individual to choose where they apply their skills and when. Unlike more traditional modes of employment, where staff are expected to accommodate all tasks thrown their way as being ‘part of the job’, the self-employed are able to choose which tasks they are comfortable being remunerated for, based on the scope of their short-term contract. This brings with it a greater sense of empowerment for the individual, allowing them to focus their attention towards those tasks they are keen to pursue. Higher levels of remuneration: There is a perception that self-employed individuals are better paid than their permanent counter-parts. Whilst this may ring true in some cases, there are certainly many examples where self-employed individuals miss out - particularly given the common lack of holiday pay or sick leave for self-employed individuals.

The idea of becoming self-employed always tends to bring with uncertainty, and fear of having to manage your own tax and compliance. Self-employed individuals are expected to manage their own tax affairs right from day one, and for some people this can be a pretty firm barrier that prevents them adopting self-employment. Part of the reason for this fear comes from the fact that traditional systems and processes (particularly in government) just aren’t designed to encourage or even support the self-employed. Tax cycles are all 6 or 12 months; buying professional insurance is on a 12-month cycle; getting your first mortgage as a self-employed individual can be a stressful and difficult process. None of these processes in any way support an on-demand or flexible workforce, and in some cases, they seem absolutely at odds with the very nature of self-employment and the Gig Economy. You only have to compare the payment terms of the Gig Economy with the payment terms of tax to understand just how far behind the old-world models of tax and compliance really are. So how do we embrace self-employment and disrupt those old models? When we started Hnry early in 2017, we stated that our vision was to “make self-employment simple and more accessible for anyone”.

Do you source your advice from multiple outlets? Professionals? Media? Friends and family? If you think about good financial advice the same way you might think about good medical advice, you’ll see why relying on one source of advice might be a problem. If you’re young and free of ailments, you might be perceived as having less risk and therefore not need as much medical advice as someone with more years under their belt. The same goes for financial advice: if you’re young and relatively debt free, you might not need as much financial advice as someone with multiple assets, investments, and a generally more complex (and thus more risky) financial situation. We sent out a survey a while back, asking how self-employed people manage their finances, and were astounded to see how many different sources people turned to for financial advice. These sources included the obvious financial advisers, but there was an outstanding number of self-employed people who consulted internet research, friends and family, and news outlets for financial advice. Some people even told us that they get their financial advice from subreddits and other online forums. Wherever you might find your financial advice, it’s important to maintain a “balanced diet” of professional and curated information. Just like your health, your finances are integral to your life: make sure the financial advice you receive is not all coming from your crazy uncle or /r/personalfinancenz. If you’re seeking medical advice, would you seek it out from strangers on the internet? You might get lots of interesting ideas (“do this, don’t do this, this is how I did it”) but you might also just get misdiagnosed over and over again without actually getting much actual help. With the kind of feedback we got on our survey, it’s obvious that there’s a sharp split for self-employed people: some can afford a financial adviser to give them insights, but an overwhelming number of people either cannot afford professional advice, don’t have the time, or don’t see that kind of advice as a necessary cost for the work they do. Rather, they can get advice – for free – from people they know and from strangers on the internet. This is a risky game to play.

What Is Good Financial Advice? Finding the right financial advice can be tough, but knowing what you need is a good place to start. That way you can know exactly where to turn for answers. Here are our tips for thinking about what kind of financial advice you might need: Don’t overextend your finances. Instead, focus on what’s achievable. Are you looking to set up a business? Buy a house? Do you need investment insights? Just general financial advice? Knowing what you need ahead of time can help steer you in the right direction. Make a list of your top priorities for the next five years. What financial areas do you want to work on or continue to work on? Long-term savings, house deposit, holiday savings, emergency savings, retirement – these are all viable places to start. Think about how you currently manage your finances. Do you consider yourself good with money? What do you want to see change? This will help you assess your level of need. Analyse your risk levels. What level of risk are you comfortable with and what sort of advice are you looking for? If your situation is such that you actually need a professional financial adviser (much like if you had a serious ailment, you’d go see a doctor rather than consult WebMD), then get in contact with a registered expert. Advice at What Cost? With most knowledge out there, you often get what you pay for. If you can afford them and know you need them, there are some great paid resources out there. Most financial advisers often take a commission (though some advisers charge per hour). Costs will vary based on the firm’s network and their standing in the market: the number of clients they have means their time is valuable, but this also means they might be able to connect you to a large network of resources.
