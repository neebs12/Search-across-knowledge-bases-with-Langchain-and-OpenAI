Should I be a sole trader or register a company? Being a sole trader is a lot easier than it used to be – you can have a business and not a registered company. A common misconception that people have as they head into self-employment is that they need to register a company/business in order to trade independently. This isn't the case, and registering unnecessarily can create extra work and cost for you. If you're a sole contractor or freelancer, there really isn't any need to increase your hassle and costs by registering as a company/business. Here are some of the impacts of registering a business: You will have to file both Individual (IR3) and Business (IR4) tax returns You will need to update your company details every year, and pay an annual fee to the NZ Companies OfficeYou'll be liable for company ACC payments when trading as a companyIf you are a Director of that company, you will still have some liability for any debts of that companyIf you are a sole trader, you can still choose a logo, have a trading name, and claim tax relief on your Business Expenses. As a sole trader, you get the majority of the benefits with less of the admin overhead and cost! If you have a registered company, you'll only be able to use Hnry for your Director's Drawings. You'll have to deactivate your company in order to use Hnry for everything else. If you need more help deciding what is the best structure for you, here is a very quick 3-question form that will help https://www.business.govt.nz/choose-business-structure/ Switching from a Registered Company/BusinessAfter you've ceased operating as a company, you must file a final tax return that includes your company's accounts up to the date your company ceased to operate. Until you've filed your final tax return, you haven't completed your business tax obligations. You'll also have to remove your company from the register and declare to IRD that your company has been deactivated, by filling out an IR433 form. N.B.

This is an IRD policy, and is perfectly compatible with Hnry, and very normal. Essentially, all it means is that they will deduct and pay the first small percentage of your Income Tax, and Hnry will take care of the rest. Hnry still takes care of all your remaining tax obligations on your behalf - such as the remainder of your Income Tax, as well as GST, ACC, Student Loan, Allocations etc. IR330C Forms When you start working for your employer or recruiter, you may be asked to provide them with a signed IR330C form, electing a percentage of your income for them to deduct as Income Tax. You can find a copy of this IRD form here. When filling in this form, you can elect any rate greater than or equal to the minimum standard tax rate of 10%* (15% for Non-Residents) If you choose the minimum of 10%, Hnry will still be able to get your Income Tax rate exactly right - as your Client will deduct the first 10% of Income Tax, and we will deduct the remainder. For instance, if your actual Income Tax rate determined by Hnry should be 17.45%, your employer or recruiter will deduct the first 10%, and Hnry will deduct the remaining 7.45%. Electing a rate of 10% ensures that Hnry can continue to get your tax rate exactly right over time. If you choose too high a rate on your IR330C, you could end up over-paying tax. For instance, in the same example above, if you had elected a rate of 20% on your IR330C, your client would deduct 20% from your income every time you get paid, which is higher than the actual tax rate determined by Hnry of 17.45% - leaving you out of pocket. Any over-payment of income tax deducted by your client cannot be retrieved from IRD until the end of the tax year, therefore we suggest choosing the minimum rate of 10% on the IR330C, to ensure Hnry can continue to ensure you always pay the right amount of Income Tax.

As a self-employed individual it is your choice as to how to fill in the IR330C form.

Professional Indemnity Insurance protects the assets and reputation of professionals from potentially disgruntled clients. If a client claims that you've overlooked, mistaken or misinterpreted an aspect of your service - resulting in a loss or some other damage - they can take legal action against you. Professional Indemnity Insurance helps you endure such a claim so that you don't have to deal with the financial stress of the situation. Public Liability Insurance covers you or your business in the event that an incident were to occur that is not covered by the Accident Compensation Commission (ACC). This can include any of the following: damage to a third party's property, a faulty product sold to the public, improperly installed equipment resulting in property damage or personal injury, or an injury, illness, or death caused by negligence and not covered by ACC. Do I need them? In most cases, having Professional Indemnity or Public Liability Insurance cover is optional. If you or your business provides some kind of paid advice or service, or has significant interactions with members of the public where there is a risk of legal liability on you, then you may want to consider getting insurance coverage. If you work for a government agency or take work through a large recruiter, it may be a contractual obligation for you to have a specific level of Professional Indemnity and Public Liability insurance cover. How much do they cost? Hnry may be able to provide Professional Indemnity and Public Liability insurance for you on a pay-as-you-go basis. We offer levels of cover ranging from $500,000 through to $5m (depending on the type of work you do), with fees charged as an additional percentage of your income, alongside your base Hnry Fee.

When employing someone in this way, you are responsible for paying their income regularly and submitting PayDay filing files to IRD on a regular basis (usually monthly).

They would be provided with a Hnry Payslip showing a breakdown of their earnings, and you would therefore have confidence that all of the contractor’s tax and compliance would be taken care of without any effort required from you. Should you hire someone Permanent or Contract? Whether or not you need to employ someone on a Permanent or Contract basis is entirely up to you, and will most likely be based on the nature of the work, and whether you are in a position to require a permanent member of staff rather than a contractor. Should you choose to employ someone on a Permanent/Salary basis, you wouldn’t be able to manage the relevant tax payments and submissions through Hnry, and you would need to procure separate Payroll software. Should you choose to employ someone on a contract basis, no further software would be required, and there would be no additional administration required on your part.","metadata":{"namespace":"help.hnry.io_en_articles-data","filename":"help.hnry.io_en_articles_3263830-what-is-the-difference-between-permanent-and-contract-staff.txt","link":"https://help.hnry.io/en/articles/3263830-what-is-the-difference-between-permanent-and-contract-staff","id":"help.hnry.io_en_articles_3263830-what-is-the-difference-between-permanent-and-contract-staff_1"}}],["37",{"pageContent":"Getting started with Hnry is super easy.

Getting to know you First things first, you’ll be asked to provide some basic information. Enter your first and last name, how you heard about Hnry, and your phone number. 2. What sort of work do you do? Next, enter the type of work you do. This helps us determine the right ACC levy to put you on. You can select an industry – anything from Animal & Agriculture Services to IT & Technology. If you don’t see your industry or work type in the menu, simply click ‘I can't find a close match' and enter one in the open field. 3. Self-Employed Income earned so far this Financial Year After this, we'll ask you how much self-employed income you've earned so far in the current financial year. This helps us figure out how much tax you currently owe. If you select 'yes', we'll also ask you how you've been tracking this income - which we'll use to help get you caught up when filling out the mid-year switch form later on. 4. PAYE/Salary job + other sources of income You’ll also need to indicate whether you have a PAYE (ie, salary) job, and any other sources of income. If you select 'yes' to a PAYE job, you can also specify an end date. We use all of this information when calculating how much to deduct on your behalf. 5. Income Information Next, we’ll ask you for an income estimate for the year. This info helps Hnry work best for you. The more accurate the information you provide, the more accurate your starting tax rate with Hnry will be. 6.

If you've already registered for GST, you will be due to file regular GST returns with IRD, which we’ll do on your behalf. You’ll also need to be charging 15% GST on top of the products and services you sell. Not sure if you should be GST-registered? If it looks like you’ll earn over that threshold, we’ll let you know how and when to register. 7. Student Loan We'll then ask you if you have a student loan. If you answer 'yes', we'll factor this into your deductions with each pay. 6. Registered as a Company/Business? Hnry will take care of all your personal income tax payments and filings, however, we don't make payments on behalf of registered companies. If you file a company tax return at the end of the year, you’ll need to make other arrangements. Did you know? It’s not mandatory to operate as a registered company if you’re a sole trader, and it could be the case that you’re unnecessarily burdened with more financial admin.

(Optional) Creating a Client We’ll then ask you if you know who'll be paying you into your Hnry Bank Account. These are called 'Clients' in Hnry. If you don't have a Client yet, no worries – you can just skip this step until you have a clearer idea of who might be paying you. If you do have a Client, you'll be asked to provide some basic information about them. Under 'Client name', you can indicate the name and email address of the contact person who will be paying you.

Step 1 - Sign up for ZapierIf you don’t already have a Zapier account, create one for free here.If you already have a Zapier account, start by logging in here. Step 2 - Create a ZapA 'zap' is any automated task built-in Zapier.The easiest way to get started is by trying out some of our pre-made example integrations here. We have example integrations with Toggl, FreshBooks, Pipedrive, and more. Custom WorkflowYou can also create a zap your own custom workflow to suit your needs. A zap is composed of triggers and actions. Whenever a trigger event occurs, a corresponding action is executed. Below we walk through a typical example of configuring a zap. In the example, we'll create a time tracking zap that automatically adds Items to a Hnry Invoice when time entries are logged in Toggl. To get started with this zap you’ll need a Toggl account, or you can use any other time tracking app supported by Zapier. Note: if you would like to use this particular zap there is already a pre-made template for you. Setting up the triggerLog in to your Zapier account and go to the Zap Editor.Search for Toggl.3. For the trigger event, select ‘New Time Entry’. 4. To connect your Toggl account, you will first need to log into Toggl. Head to your profile page and scroll to the ‘API Token’ section at the bottom. Copy this token and paste it into the popup: 5. Set up the trigger. The fields can be left blank or you can fill them in so that new invoice items are only created for specific workspaces, tasks, or tags within Toggl. 6. Test your Toggl trigger by clicking the ‘Test trigger’ button in Zapier.

Next, you’ll need to connect your Hnry account to Zapier. After clicking ‘Choose an account…’, you’ll be asked to log in to your Hnry profile and authorise the integration. This allows Zapier to view, edit, and create expenses, clients, and invoices on your behalf. Click ‘Confirm’ to proceed. 4. Configure the data that you want from Hnry in your trigger. You’ll need to select the invoice you want your invoice items to be added to from the dropdown menu (only draft invoices are shown). You'll also need to configure the quantity, description, and price of the invoice items. Here is an example of the filled out fields: With the fields configured as above, whenever you log a time entry in Toggl, an invoice item will be added to the invoice with invoice number INV-123319. The invoice item will have the same description as the time entry in Toggl and the quantity of the invoice item will be set to the duration in hours of the time entry logged. 5. Test your action by clicking ‘Test action’ then clicking ‘Test & Continue’. If it worked, you should see something similar to the screenshot below and an invoice item would have been added to your chosen invoice in Hnry. 6. All that's left for you to do is turn on the Zap! Once you click 'Turn on Zap,' the zap will be live and activate every time the trigger fires. Once the zap is on, you can freely log time in Toggl and invoice items will automatically be saved to the selected invoice. When you are finished logging time to an invoice and want to move on to another, simply come back to Zapier and change the invoice in the dropdown.
